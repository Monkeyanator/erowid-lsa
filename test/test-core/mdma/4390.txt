Report on the effects of three years of weekly MDMA use (note:last use ever was 4 months ago). Often Xanax (a benzodiazapene) was taken to turn the drug off at the end of the night. Xanax dependance is an unintended result.<BR>

male: age - mid 40's: female: mid 30's - both report same symptoms; both professionals<BR>
<BR>
Symptoms:<BR>
<BR>
1) insomnia <BR>
<BR>
2) mild to moderate depression (just started taking Zoloft 2 weeks ago - 5HTP did not work). Note: Post MDMA blues used to last a day or two. In the last year the after weekend blues lasted up to a week or more. Since ceasing use 4 months ago depression has continued.<BR>
<BR>
3) lack of ability to concentrate and focus<BR>
<BR>
4) short term memory loss got worse in the last year - now long term memory loss is evident<BR>
<BR>
Fear - seratonin depletion may be permanent. Trying to see if Zoloft (an SSRI) will replenish seratonin and cure depression and insomnia. Beware - weekly use not recommended. Never again for us.
