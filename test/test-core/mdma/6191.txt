I have taken x probly around 200 or 300 pills. It was great for a while but then all of a sudden they started knocking me out like a valium. Around 1 hour after I take it I have this urge to just sleep. I can only accomplish staying awake if I mix coke with it. I have stopped doing X all together because of this. In our little group of people that we hang around with I seem to be the only one affected like this.<BR>
