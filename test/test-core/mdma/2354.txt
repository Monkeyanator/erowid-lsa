I did some ecstasy on Saturday. I got it from a guy I work with.<BR>
It was a nice surprise! I bought a 'Full Moon,' or what was supposed to be<BR>
two doses. I'd gotten MDMA a few times in '89 and '90, but it wasn't that<BR>
strong... of course that was $8-10 and the Full Moon cost me $30. It was a<BR>
white powder, like the other stuff I'd had, in a clear gelcap.<BR>
<BR>
        A major snowstorm was predicted Saturday night, so I waited until<BR>
it started snowing then took the whole thing, at around midnight. It hit<BR>
me real slowly, and in about 1 to 1 1/2 hours I peaked. I spent an hour or<BR>
two curled up on the floor just thinking. I couldn't keep my eyes open<BR>
because the natural beauty and beingness of everything was just too<BR>
intense. The most mundane objects took on a new light, things were<BR>
beautiful simply by being what they were. A totally different experience<BR>
from LSD, mundanely beautiful rather than cosmically and intensely<BR>
profound. It was very insightful in a simplistic way. I went out in the<BR>
snow that had built up to about 5 inches by then. The beauty of everything<BR>
in virgin snow with big fluffy flakes falling heavily... I can't describe<BR>
it. Heavenly. I finally fell asleep around 6. I awoke to a world changed<BR>
by snow and a self changed by ecstasy. Its left me with a sense of<BR>
purpose, renewal, and focus on the now.
