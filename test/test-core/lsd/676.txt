My first time ever on acid was not too long ago. I was so very exited about my first time, because I have heard how good it was or is. Well let me tell you this trip was sure interesting. Me and my best girl friend went on a field trip to Magic Mountain, so we decided that the trip would be more fun if we did some type of drug. So we decided acid would be the one. Well we sure did have an interesting trip.<BR>
<BR>
We decided to take the tabs about an hour before getting to Magic Mountain. So we took them in the bus. Not too long after taking them everything started to have its own world. My trip started about me complaining how hot and smoggy it was. The day was actually pretty cold. My friend was telling me to be quiet because it was just me and the drug saying this, but really I was sooo hot and could not breathe because of the 'smog'. I didn't know what was going on. I was kinda scared.<BR>
<BR>
During this trip I brought my diary along with me and here is what my friend and I wrote in the bus (the writing looks like a 3 year old wrote it):<BR>
<BR>
'Dear Diary,<BR>
This is soo cool love,<BR>
(My friends name)'<BR>
Right below it there is a drawing of a stick person flying.<BR>
'I feel undressed Wow<BR>
Yeah I kick ass no out (something, I can't tell what it says) read love to write it lets out emotions'<BR>
<BR>
and then I wrote...<BR>
'Me too I have the weirdest feeling ever I feel like I can just  SPLAT ! on you. If you know what I mean I don't know where to take it in. I'm trying so hard not to let it in but this is one of those things that it just comes out. Wow I haven't ever felt like this before it is strange I can't help it. I feel like I'm still on my period. I have never ever felt like this in my whole life. Maybe I'm just faking it ugh I feel like I'm this is sooo hard to try to keep it to just my self I think I'm seeing things I never had before, yeah right I'm just trying too hard. Shit but I feel it wanting to come out I'm okay this is nothing I'm just trying too hard. It's the damn bus that wont let me it's moving but see everyone else is doing fine I hate it I hate it. I can't breathe'<BR>
<BR>
You know writing this is giving me this weird sentation. But anyway.<BR>
The trip became really bad for me because I was so paranoid. I saw Jesus. I saw little cartoon characters in the freeway. I saw many other things that I am sure I don't remember. When we were almost there, I thought I threw up so I was going all weird. I don't remember too much that happened. All I know is that my friend told me that it was all just me.  I started crying because I was feeling so sick. When I got off the bus I was asking people if they went to church and asked them to pray for me.<BR>
<BR>
Later on that day while walking around the park I wanted to call my parents and my ex-boyfriend to tell them I loved them, because I thought that was my last day alive. We only got on 2 or 3 rides because I was acting so weird. Every time I was around a group of people I started to go crazy and run out of air. All the 10-11 hours we were there seemed like 2 years for me. Also that day I felt like God was calling me to be religious. Again here is something else I wrote during the trip:<BR>
<BR>
'I feel like hell I don't know the feeling or how to describe it and hope to get out of it soon because I LOVE GOD!'<BR>
<BR>
I wish I could've written more but every time I wrote my pen was melting and my diary was sooo wet. <BR>
<BR>
Well what I can say about my trip is that if I knew what to expect I would've enjoyed it. Maybe for a first timer I took too much or for a tiny girl like me. I am very short and weigh 95 pounds (and I'm 18, that is sad). I think I might try it some other time again. I already know what to expect and this time I will do it and stay inside doors.
