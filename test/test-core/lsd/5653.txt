I myself had taken LSD many times in high school but this report is about a friend who took some unwittingly. He was with my step-brother at a concert when the cute chicks behind them offered them some orange koolaid. My step-brother was an experienced LSD user and should have known better than to let his unexperienced friend drink the obviously spiked beverage. <BR>

They were both flying high by the time they got home. My step-brother was enjoying himself, knowing what to expect, but our friend definitely was not. We tried to calm him and let him know he was safe and among friends but he kept rocking back and forth and could not relax. One of the things he blurted out was that he was gay. We were his friends and suspected as much and since we loved him it didn't matter and we told him so. We phoned his brother to come get him but he didn't want to be moved. He became slightly violent but with our loving effort he went home. <BR>

We all saw him a couple of days later. He seemed a little embarassed but otherwise OK. This is not as an anti-LSD message (as I believe the things I learned while tripping are invaluable to this day), but rather as a testament to the power of friendship and love even in the most frightening of circumstances. Also, never give someone LSd without their consent!
