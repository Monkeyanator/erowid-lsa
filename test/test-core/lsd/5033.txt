A couple days ago I came home after hanging out with my friends, and was very bored. We had had a fun time just hanging out in the playground and eating fries. During that school day I had bought two douple-dipped white mice acid tabs (the equivilant of 4 tabs). My friend who had tried the same kind and amount the previous week said he had a kick-ass trip...<BR>
<BR>
I took the a tab the moment I got home, around 9:30pm. 45 minutes later the trip had kicked in and i was feeling good. I was laying under my loft bed looking up and listening to music. The visuals were cool -- shifting wavy colors and such. My thinking was also quite strange. I only remember thinking how crazy and stupid my thoughts were. However, I wasn't flying through space quite yet. I took the next tab (and a vitamin c pill) at 10:30pm. I enjoyed the relatively weak trip another half hour and BAM!!! My mind, sense of touch and sight all shifted like crazy. I felt like I was every cell in my body, rather than a whole human being. I enjoyed it and the world became extremely trippy. It was too much to explain, but the trip was simply rising and rising... untill it went bad.<BR>
<BR>
I was focusing on my stuffed leopard and the spots starting swirling around, until they looked like little snakes biting their own tail. They were purple and green with big white eyes. They looked very cartoonish and funny. I laughed hysterically. That pattern filled my whole line of sight. And then it stopped. The visuals totally stopped. My mind was still warped so I knew I was still tripping. Then slowly, everywhere I looked, totally realistic snakes slithered out of nothingness. They were on my window, my table, my bed, my closet, the floor -- everywhere. It was like the illusion in the Craft, when she saw bugs and snakes everywhere. I hate creepy stuff, and they where all looking at me. The ones on the floor slithered toward me, while the others just curled around themselves. I could hear the hissing sound, and the rattling of rattlers.<BR>
<BR>
It was too freaky. I was scared half to death. 'How could this wonderful trip just go bad like that?' I thought. They were everywhere, even when I turned my head. Some were huge and others were tiny. My backpack became a giant snake head, and my jacket that was on the floor became a bunch of snakes, the buttons were eyes. This was too much so I closed my eyes. When I did that I saw the simple snake pattern that was on the leopard -- not scary at all. But when I opened them, the creepy ones were back. With my eyes closed (this semmed to be the only way to avoid being bitten to death) I fumbled to turn on the TV. It was about 1 in the morning and Rosanne was on (stupid show). But of course the snakes were visble out of the corner of my eyes AND they were in the show too. They were climbing onto the shelf and the people in the show.<BR>
<BR>
Well, I couldn't take it anymore, so I decided to go to bed (I figured with my eyes closed I could calm down a bit). It worked, I saw crazy hyperdimensional patterns (which I see whenever I close my eyes) -- but they were way cooler. I enjoyed this (and the weird thinking) till 4am, when I finally fell asleep. I woke up at 11am and all was normal....<BR>

I don't know why my trip went psycho on me. It sounds really corny, but the fear I felt was undescribable. You have to have had a bad trip to understand what I went through. Oh well, I know I'm gonna do acid again, but this was my first time without e -- maybe my mind figured tripping and rolling belong together. I do advise being with friends when tripping (especially with higher doses). The morning after, I read 'Snakes everywhere, I wish my friends were here, so lonely and afraid -- 1:30pm' which I had written on a piece of paper (I obviously meant 1:30am).
