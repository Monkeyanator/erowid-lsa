This was the first time I have ever taken LSD and it was the worst, and I will NEVER do it again, people say that it is the best feeling, and you can see objects that you could never see unless you are on the drug but what I saw and what happened to me wasn't a pleasurable experience...<BR>
<BR>
Friday night at a party me and 2 of my friends decided we were all 3 going to trip for the first time. So we were all partying smoking pot, having a good time. Then we we talked to this dude, and he said that he could hook us up with a few hits of LSD. We said 'how many should we take?' and the dude said 'Well if it is your first time, I wouldn't take more than 5' so we all took five a piece except for one of my friends only took 3. <BR>
<BR>
So we were all still having a good time after we had taken our 5 hits, we went on partying still having a good time, and we weren't really feeling all of the side affects that everyone said we would. So then we went to go smoke up to try and get a better high. We smoke about 4-5 bowls, then went back to the party.<BR>
<BR>
EVERYTHING was different.  It was like I was in a different house, we had been gone away from the house about 2 hours and now it felt like I knew NOBODY!! I was afraid until my friend who only took 3 hits calmed me down, after about 5 minutes that seemed like 1 hour I was calm then we all went into the 'Trip-room'.  I will never forget this for the rest of my life. The room was designed for people who were tripping, and the more acid you took the more of a trip you would feel. I was sweating and I had cold chills and I was just so scared but I couldn't move my eyes from all of the lights and movements. My friend had put on a costume dressed as Chucky (from Child's Play). I hated that movie, I was so scared of it when I was a kid! It was him dressed up as Chucky but he was talkin in his real voice, so I thought he had turned into Chucky.<BR>
<BR>
It seemed so real and I tried getting a knife and stabbing him but nothing seemed to work I couldnt kill the mother fucker!! even though it was my friend behind the costume he had a bullet proof vest on and a thick protection cover underneath his costume so everytime I would stab him he would just come back at me saying 'I am the the devil and I am taking your soul' It scared the shit out of me and I couldn't stand it anymore so I left the room running down the street trying to hide because I didnt want him to take my soul I scared 'shit-less!!'<BR>
<BR>
I didn't know where to go I just knew that I had to get out of there. I finally stopped running and I looked behind me and everyone was gone I had left the party and walked about 2 miles down the road and I was at a gas station so I went in the gas station and tried to use the phone, but I couldn't remember the number to my friends cell phone, so I called up a different friend to get my out of that damn place. He said he would call the party and tell someone to come get me....well he called the party and told the guy that was wearing the Chucky costume to come pick me up. That was the end I was so freaked out.<BR>
<BR>
I was at the peak of my Trip and I couldn't stand it anymore.  I went into convulsions, and I started shaking and having a seizure! They all rushed me to the hospital and, the doctor gave me some kind of shot, and just told me to wait it out. It may not seem like that was scary but think about something that scared you when you were a kid and then have some dress up in that same costume. If it doesn't scare the shit out of you, then you didnt take Acid!<BR>
<BR>
I will never do LSD again and I am not saying that everyone shouldn't do it, just make sure you know how much to take the first time you do it, and be around people you are good friends with!
