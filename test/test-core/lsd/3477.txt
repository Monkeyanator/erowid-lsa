This is the story of the first time I had acid. It scared me incredibly, as I had no knowledge at all of the strength of LSD.<BR>
<BR>
The first tab of Acid I had was called a '3D Parallelogram' which were going around Sydney in 1995. These were reportedly (in hindsight) extremely strong tabs. I was in Year 9 at high school at the time. I bought it off a friend who had never used acid before who told me that acid was similar to marijuana in it strength level. Therefore, about 10am I preceded to drop 1 whole acid trip. This would commence what was one of the scariest drug experiences of my life.<BR>
<BR>
At approximately 10:30am I started tripping in history class. The teachers face started morphing, and I just prayed that he didn't ask me any questions. At morning break, around 11am, I went up to my friend who sold me the trip and explained to him how fucked up I was. He told me that he had licked the plastic bag out which the trip came in, and he was even tripping off that! <BR>
<BR>
So, after morning break I decided to go for a walk out in the city to try and stem the increbile psychedelic visions going through my mind. Luckily, one of my closest buddies had also dropped acid that day for the first time so we stuck together. Venturing into a cafe to have a coffee, and hopefully to try and get my head together, I suddenly had the feeling that everything was in 'fast-forward' mode. It was like a 20 minute period would pass in a matter of seconds. Sounds, and images, were sped up to a blurry pace. It was only when I dropped a little sugar on the table in front of me in the cafe, and I noticed the little pieces of sugar talking to me, and then running away from me, that I realised how messed up I was.<BR>
<BR>
Upon returning to school I went straight to the sick-bay with my mate and we stayed there until school finished a 3 pm. In this period I had some incredible journeys into my mind. Tunnels of psychedelic patterns engrossed me. I also had hallucinations of snakes tunneling around the room underneath the carpet.<BR>
<BR>
Once the bell at 3 pm went off we were free to leave. Being paranoid, I approached the secretary and asked her if I was in fact, free to leave. She told me that I was so I took a moment in front of her desk to put my school jumper on. Before I put the jumper on I noticed the clock read 3:01pm. I struggled for a little while to put the jumper on and one I had completed this task I looked again at the clock and it now read 3:15pm. I looked at the secretary and she gave me a really funny look!!<BR>
<BR>
I made it home in one piece, but along the way experienced a few stange encounters with strangers with whom I got paranoid with.<BR>
<BR>
All together it was a good warning about the power of acid, and the conclusion was that it should be taken rarely, and only with a great deal of care. I have taken a great deal of MDMA since, and I have never experienced anything so 'bone-shaking' as this LSD experience.
