I took acid 15 times in 2 years in the early 1990s and found it an amazing experience, and like all new experiences, modified my view of the world. For me, the new experiences stopped after 3 trips and the remainder were a waste of time.<BR>
<BR>
Unfortunately I had a number of side effects that I attribute to LSD. these were:<BR>
<BR>
Depersonlisation (duration 1-2 week after trip) - sometimes after taking strong (200ug+) acid I would loose all sense of my self - as if I was a robot/non human. <BR>
<BR>
Recurring Pulsing light (in between trips) - Regularly during sleep or drowsing I would feel all woozy and then experience a painful rapid white pulsing light in my head, blocking out all thoughts, followed by murky near vision hallucinations of geometric shapes that were exactly the same as the visuals I experienced on acid. Curiously after this I would feel at complete peace -serene-as if my head had been 'flushed' of all problems. This stopped immediately after stopping acid.<BR>
<BR>
Associations/Rationalising - Perhaps the most serious side effect, lasting a number of years(3-5) after final use, was that I was my ability to rationalise in everyday life was seriously hampered. I was making wrong connections/associations - for example I believed my 'fate' was geared around the number '67' which related to (amongst other things) the number of letters in a poet's name whose poems 'spoke' to me, addresses of houses, names of girlfriends (the list goes on...)<BR>
<BR>
To conclude, what an experience! but I wouldn't take it more than a few times if I had my time again.
