Here is my journal pages from the first time I ever tripped. It's a bit tough to follow but here goes. It's not too long I hope you enjoy my first trip. It was really intense but the writing I did that night was not just random thoughts.<BR>
<BR>
(That is all I wrote....the night was long and fantastic. I could probably tell you more now about what happened but that is what I wrote. The whole trip was in a car ride for hours. We drove miles and it seemed like minutes. Tell me what you think)<BR>
<BR>
9:45 I just ate 3 pieces of mushrooms 2 stems and a cap. It's 9:45pm on Friday. I'll write a bit...45 minutes I'm a bit strange because I like the tast of shrooms.<BR>
<BR>
10:00 I'm just nervous in anticipation the above cost 15$. I don't know the guy who sold them to me but my friend said they are good. I just bought two more small pieces for 3$ 2 small stems. I don't have much in my stomic I just ate an orange. I'm real nervous. 'Gone! Like Candy.' Craig Murphy said. Bill and Matt just left. I only didn't get one class at Umass. I want to listen to music.<BR>
<BR>
10:05 (more boaring stuff like the above)<BR>
<BR>
10:15 I'm feeling a bit strange. Nothing too strange...yet.<BR>
<BR>
10:20 Nothing much yet. Bill and I are going to smoke to increase the trip. What I've eaten today 2 pizza slices. 2 two chicken tenders some water soda crackers<BR>
<BR>
10:25 I'm feeling rather normal...I think.<BR>
<BR>
10:30- I feel like laughing so bad.<BR>
<BR>
10:45 I'm in the dark its tough to write. I just smoked. I wonder what is going to happen? The crickets are really loud and distinct.<BR>
<BR>
11:00 I'm in Matts car (he is straight) lights out. We are going north on 93. Huge speakers loud music. Black Sabboth Ministry. I'm tripping good.<BR>
<BR>
How do I write it.. It connects everything. The drug connects the music to everythig. Everything is dancing. Everyting is a neat green. I can come in and out of the 'trip' to semi reality and then back in to no reality. I'm going back in. In and out of two worlds.<BR>
<BR>
11:15 I'm in the dark driving...wow.<BR>
<BR>
(at this point I stoped keeping track of time)<BR>
<BR>
I don't want to write because I like to be zoned. I'm gone. is that.. wow.. Is that a face I cant read what I'm writing do you understand me. Lumberjack (what a funny word while triping try it) Lumberjack she said and I laughed whole lotta love whole lotta love love you hey Baby M led Zeppelin boy wow I love Zeppelin<BR>
<BR>
my left hand wow everything is melting just like Billy said I can put my hand in my brain I am massaging my brain I have become def<BR>
<BR>
All important is the now what I write in the past has no signifigance only what is coming off my pen right now.<BR>
<BR>
(now my friend Craig wrote a bit)<BR>
<BR>
Some people cry, funny trip ride it THE SONG this is fun Do you think stan is the cookie monster I dont know<BR>
<BR>
