Last weekend, three friends and I went out to the mountains in hope of finding some Golden tops. I was extremly excited as i had taken them once before at home and could not get over the sheer beauty of the experience.<BR>
Anyway, we did find some in the cow paddocks and all of us ingested roughly the same amout - 5 or so mushrooms of a medium to smallish size, plus some extra stems and peices of the caps.<BR>
<BR>
Within the hour, Everything started to become so bright and beautiful, colours were so pure in their intensity and the inner joy and peace i felt was literally undescribable. wilst colours were bright and beautiful, it had the look as though there was a softening filter on everything i saw, and my female companion looked so raidiant and her movements were soft and slow like a very gentle stream, i had so sence of time as i felt transported to a higher spiritual heaven where i could conect with my deepest fears and pain and cry like i never have before and also really get in touch with the beautiul and treasured things in my life.<BR>
For one of the few times in my life i felt truely honest and for 6 or so hours really thought about so many things with a clarity beyond my normal abilitys.<BR>
<BR>
it truely was so intencely spiritual but completely real as I learned and learned and learned. The main thing that struck me on both occaisions was the absalute clarity of my thoughts and feelings. It was truely a BETTER reality - not just a different one as i have felt with all other drugs i have taken. and afterwards I can recall evrything and i have benefited greatly from the experience and have nothing but the utmost respect for life and its possible beauty, i feel renewed as if my dreams are acheivable and my past has been shed away.<BR>
<BR>
all in all, i have not experienced anything like it, nor have I had a negative reaction from it though i know the rest of my friends have.
