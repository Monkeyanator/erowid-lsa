My friends and I had decided to go to an all day concert and trip out on shrooms. I acquired about a half oz about a month before the concert. We got them early because they are hard to come by unless you put in an order ahead of time. I ended up eating 5 grams the night I got them and giving my friend 3 grams. That was a good night. The day of the concert I got off work early and we all met at my friends house. We also acquired an oz of bud because we were going to another concert the next day. I took my dose of shrooms before we left for the concert. I ended up eating an undetermined amount but I had to of eaten at least 8 grams and I gave my friend a decent cap. At the concert only 20mins later I was already feeling the shrooms but wasn't tripping yet. We had taken two cars and ended up losing the others in the parking lot. I was already tripping hardcore by the time we found them. We were at Smokin Grooves and all the guys there wanted to act hard and be like a gangbanger so it was hard to feel comfortable there. Then we went up on the hill (it's an outdoor concert with a huge hill behind the seats) and that was when everything went bad.<BR>

I kept seeing things and hearing things. I would see people I knew and when I went to say hi it wasn't them. When somebody would talk to me it wouldn't make any sense and I walked around really confused. I really couldn't do anything about the bad trip cause there was nowhere to go and if I freaked out I was scared of getting into a fight. One of the girls I was with who was also tripping saw that I was having a hard time and calmed me down by making me look at the grass and the sky.<BR>

Then this guy sat down next to me and asked me if I wanted to buy some shrooms. I looked at him and almost had a heart attack. He had horns and smoke was coming out of his eyes and he basically reminded me of the devil. He looked at me and saw my pupils and said something along the lines of your already trippin balls aren't you. I could only nod my head and then he looked normal again. He pulled out at least an oz and said he would give it to me for $60. I told him that i didn't want any (cosidering the fact that his eyes didn't show any color and he kept twitching) because I thought it might me laced. Then some kid sat down next to him and said he'd buy the bag. When he found out the price he said he only had $45 and wanted to buy what he could with that. The guy gave hime maybe 5 grams and took off into the crowd. I started to laugh and the kid looked at me and asked what was so funny. I told him that he just paid for at least 12-14 grams and only got around 5. He got pissed and took off.<BR>

After that I kept telling myself that my trip was going away and eventually it did. All in all it lasted about 3-4 hours and wore off. It wasn't fun at all. everybody else said that their trip was bad to and we decided to only trip in a place that was comfortable to us with people we trusted. That is my only bar experience I have had and I plan to trip on lsd over Christmas with a girl I'm good friends with. It didn't scare off of tripping but it made me be more carfeul of the situation I do it in.
