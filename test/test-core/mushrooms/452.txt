I am an asthmatic, so I had never tried pot before, although being interested in drugs since I was a child, I had tried mushrooms 3 times before. I was low on cash so I only chipped in for 1/16th of an once, and was not expecting much of a trip. We all ate our mushrooms, put on some music and waited for them to kick in. Many of my friends are heavy pot users, and began to pass a bong around, I am a very infrequent user. I proceeded to smoke for about 20min with them, and was in the middle of complaining about the poor quality of the mushrooms when the table I was looking at started to bend in the middle. I took this as a sign and shutup. In my past experiences with mushrooms, I found a connection to myself that is normally absent, and a lack of fear (social fear). The trip lasted for about 3 hours, and was nothing profound. I attribute this to the amount of pot I smoked. Toward the end of the trip, I became too stoned to finish the hit I was taking at the time and started to freak.!<BR>

I was able to calm myself down, but not before looking a little too gone to my friends. Many people smoke pot to aid potency of mushrooms, not I. I do not think I will ever smoke and trip at the same time again, as I was too baked too apreciate the inner connections gained by ingesting mushrooms. I had never even come anywhere close to freaking out before that night, and I suggest to others that they be very carefull with pot and mushrooms.
