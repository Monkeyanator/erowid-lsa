This is not a report from a single experience on mushrooms, rather a warning and useful advice that i hope you will take into consideration before your next trip. I would consider myself an avid user of psilocybe mushrooms and believe that they can be very useful for spiritual self introspection in the right hands. I also believe that mushrooms are a much stronger drug than many people give them credit for. Since the first time I used mushrooms I have witnessed three seizures resulting from their ingestion. The first was a good friend of mine who had been indulging in a pretty large amount of cubensis picked the night before from a nearby field. It was Thanksgiving day and we were inside a fast food place ordering some food when my friend walked out of the bathroom and stated that he didn't feel so good and then proceeded to fall onto the floor and go into slight convulsions. Another friend and I tried to pick him and drag him out to the car as everybody in the restaurant was flipping out but he had truly turned into jello. He was slipping through our hands like water. <BR>
<BR>
Once we got to the car he started to come back to reality and had no recollection of what had happened. as I drove off it occured to me that he was driving prior to me and I thanked god that this didn't happen while he was behind the wheel. <BR>
<BR>
The next incident happened to another good friend of mine just out of my reach. He went into the bathroom as we all sat in the living room where we heard what sounded like him banging on the shower door. when we went into the bathroom he was on the floor just regaining consiousness, blood pouring out of his head where he had cut his ear open on the trashcan and then hit his head on the ground. He described what he called violent convulsions but wasn't quite sure what had happened. The last incident happened just two days ago to my sister which is what has compelled me to write this. There were six of us and we bought an ounce of hydroponic mushrooms to split between us all. We ate the mushrooms at my house and then went to enjoy the sights of downtown Portland where i am currently residing. We walked around for hours starting at about midnight enjoying the sights basically trippin' balls. <BR>
<BR>
As we were walking back to the truck my sister sat down on the ground. I asked if she was ok and she said that she simply wanted to sit down. I told her we should sit on a bench where we wouldn't look so odd in the middle of downtown at four in the morning. we got up and started walking to a bench when she stated that she felt really fucked up and then started falling to the ground. I managed to catch her before she hit the ground and started calling her name trying to bring her back to conciousness. She lay there with a cold blank stare in her wide open eyes for what seemed like forever but was probably about fifteen seconds but i'm not really sure. After she regained conciousness she still seemed a little out of it but was functioning normally. she was mainly wondering why everyone was around her and I was asking stupid questions like 'do you know where you are' or 'how many fingers am I holding up.' I told her to stay there and walked the remaining ten or so blocks to the car an brought it back to pick her up. <BR>
<BR>
By then she had figured out what had happened and apologized to me for having to go through that. I have always played the role of the designated driver on mushrooms but I now firmly believe that NOBODY should drive on mushrooms. These three incidences all happened to what I would consider experienced and responsible drug users. This is a very spontaneous thing and it can happen to you, me, or anybody using mushrooms. DO NOT DRIVE WHILE ON MUSHROOMS AND DO NOT GET IN A CAR WITH ANYONE WHO HAS USED MUSHROOMS! I am lucky. I could very easily be dead. furthermore I would suggest having a sober babysitter or at least someone who is very experienced with what you are doing. I am surprised to find no reports of this kind anywhere and I will do everything within my power to get the word out. Happy shroomin'
