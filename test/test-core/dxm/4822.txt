After doing all the research I could on DXM, most of it here on Erowid, my girlfriend and I decided to give it a try.  We brought home 2 bottles of cough syrup, but decided to split one since it was our first time.  I plugged my nose and downed the thick red stuff as fast as I could.  When I was done, all I could think about was 'Wow, there's no turning back now!'<BR>
<BR>
For the first little while, there was nothing.  Then, in small but steady waves, the disorientation began to take hold.  I started feeling really out of my head by the one hour mark and Pink Floyd was playing on the stereo.  It all started to get overwhelming and I had to turn the music off.  Sweat started pouring down my face and I could feel my mind begin to slip away.  No matter what position I sat in, I couldn't get comfortable and my skin tingled like crazy.<BR>
<BR>
I tried smoking some grass, but after the first toke, a strong and terrifying nausea gripped hold of me and I had to run to the bathroom.  After puking twice, the diarrhea set in and I stayed in the bathroom for almost two hours, alternating between shitting and puking, although the only thing I was expelling by then was water.<BR>
<BR>
The dehydration was awful, but I couldn't seem to hold down any water.  I would have killed my own mother for an IV.  I crawled back into the living room, nursing my water bottle, taking the occasional sip.  The TV was on, but I was too lost in DXM land to notice or care.  If I hadn't felt so sick and weak, I probably would have enjoyed the feeling.  I thought I was dying for awhile, and I was lost in some deep dark void for the rest of the trip, yet I was just feeling too awful to enjoy any of it.<BR>
<BR>
The next day, I stayed home from university to recover and hydrate.<BR>
<BR>
The whole experience felt like the flu on Mescaline and was an overall negative experience.  On the other hand, besides the Robo Itch, my girlfriend had a great time and wants to do it again someday.  She didn't feel sick at all.<BR>

What I've learned from all of this is that DXM has three possible outcomes.  Really Good, So/So, or REALLY BAD!  How it will affect you cannot be predicted, so know that you've got a 33% chance of getting really sick, rapidly dehydrating and having a miserable time before you decide that DXM might be a good idea.  Then again, you have the same chance of having a really GOOD time, so don't let anyone else tell you what your experience is going to be like.  You'll have to find out on your own.
