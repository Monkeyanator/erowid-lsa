Just a note about drug testing and DXM.  I've used to use DXM heavily, off and on for a couple of years.  The last time I used, I managed to overdose and came to from my blackout in the emergency room, which supremely sucked.  They did a drug test on me, though I had told them what I had taken.  I tested positive for weed & PCP.  I had smoked weed the two previous days, and that night, but besides DXM, that was the only drug I had touched.  I've never done PCP in my life (after my lengthy experiences with DXM, don't want too), so this came as a suprise.  Oh well, I did't get in trouble, and it did cause me to make some changes in my life.
