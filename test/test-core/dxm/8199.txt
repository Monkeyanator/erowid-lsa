I had taken approx. 200mg of DXM by drinking cough syrup.  About a week later I passed out due to heat exaustion (totally unrelated) and was taken to the hospital. While there PCP was detected in my blood but in a later urine test nothing was found. The urine test was given about 3 hours after the blood test was done. <BR>

From my experiance i conclude that dxm can make you test false positive for PCP in blood tests but not urine tests at a week after ingestion, so be careful if you know you're going to be tested.
