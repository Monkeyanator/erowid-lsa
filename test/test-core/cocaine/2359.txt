This was far from my first time using cocaine... I'd had it perhaps 2 dozen times since 1990... but this time I decided to try and document the effects as they occured.<BR>
<BR>
Nov. 23, 1997<BR>
-------------<BR>
<BR>
11:27pm:<BR>
        I just cut out two medium-to-small sized lines of cocaine. I've<BR>
already had about 6 or 7 lines over the past 3 hours or so, the last<BR>
being a little over an hour ago. I smoked a bowl of pot about 45 minutes<BR>
ago, but its effects are pretty much unnoticeable, except maybe a slight<BR>
reduction in the edginess of the cocaine effects. I'm definately still<BR>
feeling the effects, although I'm in the come-down stage at present. The<BR>
next 2 lines should give me a pretty typical high-dose cocaine experience.<BR>
At present, I feel contradictorally wired and tired. I feel as if I could<BR>
fall asleep if I wanted, although from experience I know I couldn't yet. I<BR>
feel a warm fuzzy feeling all over my body, similar to the feeling of the<BR>
second wind you get when you stay up all night, but there is also a mild<BR>
feeling of stimulant tension. Euphoria has definately long since passed.<BR>
Cocaine makes me dehydrated, and this manifests itself primarily in the<BR>
feeling of dry mouth. I will frequently suck on my cheeks, trying to<BR>
salivate, I guess. It's not really a conscious thing. Its a bad thing,<BR>
actually, as it makes the dry mouth worse, and sometimes will leave my<BR>
mouth feeling uncomfortable the next day. I'm going to finish my<BR>
cigarette, then do these lines.<BR>
<BR>
11:33pm:<BR>
        I snort the lines, and immediately feel both euphoria, and a<BR>
passing urge to get the rest of my coke out and do more. I get the urge to<BR>
smoke a cigarette, so I do. The high intensifies for a minute or two then<BR>
levels. I'm mildly euphoric, but very stimulated. Its a distinct<BR>
stimulation, more like amphetamines than caffeine. But definately<BR>
different. There is a mild anesthetic property, mainly concentrated in my<BR>
mouth and nose, and a generalized tingly, warm sensation. I notice myself<BR>
typing alot harder, but pausing more between sentences. The urge to smoke<BR>
my cigarette is overwhelming. There is a warm feeling along my spine.<BR>
Mentally, I feel both calm and stimulated, somewhat paradoxically. If<BR>
there were people here, I'd be talkative.<BR>
<BR>
11:38pm:<BR>
        I am feeling a barely perceptible decrease in the high, and decide<BR>
to stop typing for a little bit to enjoy it, probably with another<BR>
cigarette. The urge to do more coke occasionally pops into my mind but<BR>
then leaves just as quickly.<BR>
<BR>
11:53pm:<BR>
        I went and smoked a cigarette, and alternated (quite frequently)<BR>
between walking around my room smoking it, sitting on the edge of my bed,<BR>
and putting down the cigarette to lay down and close my eyes. Laying down,<BR>
I felt very calm, and as if my body were floating. The peak wore off<BR>
gradually, and not evenly. I would alternate between feeling come-down<BR>
effects and peak effects, with the come-down periods becoming longer and<BR>
more frequent.<BR>
<BR>
        The euphoria is mostly gone now, and the thoughts of doing more<BR>
coke are a little more frequent and longer, but are nowhere near<BR>
irresistable. Simply being aware of the craving seems to make it go away.<BR>
I took a multivitamin just now, which I always do before bed anytime I do<BR>
any drugs outside of my usual ones (pot, tobacco, and caffeine). It<BR>
generally reduces day-after fatigue. The stimulation is still quite<BR>
strong, and more amphetamine-like, although it is beginning to fade into<BR>
the post-peak mellowness of cocaine. I am almost back to the point I was<BR>
when I began writing this.<BR>
<BR>
        Physically, the dry-mouth has become more noticable again. My<BR>
lungs feel sort of grimy from smoking too many cigarettes (cocaine tends<BR>
to make me chain smoke), and my nasal passages feel somewhat clogged and<BR>
sore from doing coke all night. I snorted a few drops of warm water to<BR>
help clear out my nose, which helped significantly. I can still<BR>
occasionally taste cocaine in the back of my throat if I snort or breath<BR>
deeply through my nose.<BR>
<BR>
12:05am:<BR>
        I'm basically back to where I was at the beginning now. I feel<BR>
calm and quiet. I don't really feel bad, although there have been times<BR>
when I've felt quite depressed and physically worn when I've done alot of<BR>
cocaine in a short time. I feel physically worn out, and mentally a little<BR>
tired, but its definately not a bad thing - basically like being<BR>
overtired, despite the fact that I know I could not fall asleep right now.<BR>
I've probably done about 1/2 gram over the course of about 4 hours, which<BR>
although is alot, is nowhere near the most I've done; that would probably<BR>
be about 1.5 grams over 2 or 3 hours. Aside from the two lines I did while<BR>
writing this, I used the cocaine in a social setting tonight, with a girl<BR>
and a guy I'm friends with. Its when doing it alone that I'll sit there<BR>
and do line after line until it's gone or I just can't take anymore.<BR>
<BR>
        I plan on smoking a small bowl of pot to relax, and write a little<BR>
more. I'm going to take a 3mg melatonin tablet and probably a shot of<BR>
tequila before I go to bed, to counteract the stimulant effect that would<BR>
keep me from sleeping. I'll still probably be unable to sleep for about an<BR>
hour, perhaps more, but it will definately help, though it will probably<BR>
make me groggier tomorrow.<BR>
<BR>
        Overall, it was an enjoyable experience, but not outstandingly so.<BR>
Cocaine simply isn't my drug of choice. I'm glad I did it, but it'll<BR>
probably be a while before I do it again.<BR>
<BR>
12:16am:<BR>
        I take my melatonin, and take a hit off my bowl. This experiment<BR>
is at an end.
