For all you cocaine addicts who want to get rid of the drug, this is worth your reading.<BR>
<BR>
This explains how taking pure MDMA (ecstasy) will get rid of your cocaine addiction.<BR>

One night I had an eightball (4 grams of cocaine) for my friends and I. I decided not to do the cocaine and just cut it up for them and smooth it out. The best tool to do this is a pizza cutter. Anyway, I made some lines for them and they started snorting them. There was one first-timer; she was 15 yrs old. She was addicted on the spot. No stopping her, she wanted more, causing a fit because we wouldn't give her more. I left the cocaine on my desk and went to bed. I woke up to 1 gram left; they did 2 grams while I was asleep, stayed up all night doing cocaine.<BR>

I had 1 gram left. My girlfriend came over. She thought it would be cool to snort some coke because she had heard good highs about the drug. She did one line, loved it, wanted more, and more, and more, crying at me for not giving her more. I gave in, gave her another line, and then another, eventually finishing off the last gram of cocaine.<BR>

She was addicted. I got phone calls all times of the day, asking for me to get her some more cocaine. I decided to get her a new drug, try ecstasy. I gave her the purest pill of MDMA I could find. She did it, loved it, was horny as hell, good in bed I must add. I noticed she was not asking for cocaine anymore. She wasn't asking for any drug anymore. I then realised that the ecstasy she had taken rid her of her addiction to cocaine. I gave some ecstasy to my friends who were addicted to cocaine. It worked; they were all not addicted to cocaine anymore! Try it, you'll see ecstasy changes your life and cocaine addiction.
