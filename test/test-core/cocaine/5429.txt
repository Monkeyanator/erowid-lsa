When people tell you that it only takes one try to get you addicted to something as strong as Coke I always tended disagree.  For instance my first time with Coke was a fun experience, I tried it, liked it and didnt get too much of a come down and that was that.  At the time it was a great high but I only had 3 lines so it wasnt the smack in the face impact I was expecting although I remembered very clearly how it made me feel.<BR>
  <BR>
Several months later I lost a best friend through suicide which kind of fucked everybody up.  I was seeing my friends crying, arguing and fighting amongst themselves over stupid things and I just didnt want to be a part of it.  So I thought I would try coke again just to get me through the next weeek or two as I remembered the feeling of euphoria which made everything ok for a while. <BR>
 <BR>
I got my hands on a gram which I thought would be enough for a few days but it only lasted till that night but that wasnt a problem I found out that a friend of mine was pals with a dealer so I got another gram the next day.  Two weeks on I found myself falsely coping with everything around  me and I was spending a fortune on Coke but I still didnt think I had a problem.  I would tell myself I had better stop or I willl become an addict, so I could stop,  but it was only till the next day when I realised that I wanted more.  The highs I experienced were immense,  felling like there was nothing that could get me down and I would get along with everybody, I was... well in heaven, but I found out to my harm that once you were up there you couldnt get any higher no matter how much you could take.  <BR>
<BR>
Now I was starting to get worried so I turned to someone who I thought was a friend and explained to them and only them that I was constantly on coke.  All I wanted from telling this person was someone who would listen to me and not freak out.  But days later another one of my 'friends' came up to me and asked if I was on coke.  So, I am paranoid person as it is, when I heard this I started freaking out about who knew and who would find out so I fell out with nearly all of my friends and got really heavy into it.  It got so bad my nose would bleed for about an hour solid beause I couldnt be bothered cutting my stuff properly.  I also wouldnt leave my room unless it was for coke because I was so paranoid I thought everybody in my work and my town were talking about me, trying to get me to admit I was a junky.  <BR>
<BR>
Then one day I flipped completely got 2 G's cut them, lined them out and started snorting as much as I could, line after line only stopping to allow my nose to clear so I could start again.  After an hour I passed out and woke up in hospital with tubes in my nostrils and down my throat.  I couldnt speak for about a week after because too much coke went down my throat and burnt tiny holes all over.  To this day there are still people I can hear whispering when I walk past them, I know I had a problem and I know that I will never take it again but it proved me wrong that no matter how strong I thought I was, under the wrong circumstances I could and did become addicted to something.<BR>

Its as easy as that!!!!
