I used to always be against hard drugs such as cocaine. I stuck to weed and alcohol; I did acid twice, but that was a real weird experience.  When people would do coke around me, I would always look bad upon them.  My friends started doing it, and one time they convinced me to do just one line, so I did.  It didn't feel too great, because it was a small one, except for the burst of energy.<BR>

The next weekend I wanted to do more, and we did about 6 lines each.  I was so torn up, it felt good for like a good half hour, and then pretty much knocked me off my ass.  We did some more, and I loved it.  Ever since then, I think I'm hooked. It feels so good to take those lines up my nose. I want to stop and I'm not into it that much yet, but I have a feeling that I want it all the time, and when I don't get it it's like the worst feeling in the world.<BR>

I hope I'm not addicted...but I think it's too late.
