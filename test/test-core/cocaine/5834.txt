My experience with cocaine is much like every other addict's.  useless. To even consider doing this drug more than once in a while is asking to become addicted. The first time i ever did coke was when i was sixteen.  My mom's boyfriend gave me about the equivalent to 4 or 5 lines in the span of an hour.  The first time is always wonderful, but its never the same.  <BR>

Soon I got depressed and started to value things a lot less, I didn't even  know myself anymore.  After i initially was introduced to cocaine, i thereafter began to do it every day. and if i didn't have it i was a nervous wreck.  I chewed all of my finger nails off and threw up at the thought of more cocaine.  During the summer, why i still don't know, i just up and moved across the country...for some reason that i don't even know.  <BR>
I guess i knew that i had no hook up for coke there so in two days i had moved out of some crazy idea i had.  I stayed with my parents for a month and a half and went through all of the withdrawls, and no one truely knows what cocaine withdrawls are like unless you have been through them.  It was horrible, like a bad dream.  I am writing this submission in hopes that someone like me will read this and realize that cocaine does change people drastically and to think first before you try it.  If you cannot handle it or even if you have doubts about if you will not have the power to stop after you start then dont even try it.  And what is the point of paying someone so much money to make you sick and give you one of the hugest obstacles that is imaginable.<BR>

I have now been coke free for 8 months. I abused cocaine for around 3 and 1/2 months and i still crave it sometimes and i still bite my nails when i think about it, but now i have realized that cocaine is truely useless.
