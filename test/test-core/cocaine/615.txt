A few nights ago I met up with a close friend of mine and he informed me that he had purchased a half gram of cocaine.  Now, I had never done cocaine before and I was a little cautious about trying it.  Having heard all the horror stories of addiction on the first try and even death.  I trust my friend completely and asked him what coke was about, he never really gave me a straight answer, but that is exactly what i expected.  Later on that night we smoked a small amount of marijuana and about an hour later cut up the coke.  First he took a line, gave me a look of sheer pleasure and told me to have at it.  I eagerly took mine next.  A short time after I was feeling great.  <BR>

We sat down and just talked about all sorts of topics, our thoughts were racing and our mouths were just trying to keep up.  My mind had become clear, and all inhibitions had gone away.  My body was full of energy and at the same time completely relaxed.  Almost what i would call a euphoric experience.  <BR>

Once the drug started to wear off, I had the idea that more coke would be a really good idea, but we were out and that idea soon left my head.  Now, as i see it, coke has a bad reputation, and costs SO much money.  I have been told that I am very much in control of my mind, so I have hard time losing control with substances.  The times i have tripped LSD, not once have I lost it or freaked out.  To me it's the drugs, and they will wear off.  Coke is fun when it comes around, but as far as spending money on it, no way!  I am willing to using coke more, but only if it's free and only with the people i trust.  This is good advice for all.  <BR>

I will leave you with this last thought...Once you try cocaine, you will think that it is lots of fun and no big deal.  Just don't let it become a habit, and you will not have a problem with it.  Have fun = )
