I just thought I would tell you about COKE.  To start off, it kicks major ass, but there are some things you should know.  The first time you won't get addicted, you just think you are. (In my case anyway.)  But here's my story:<BR>
<BR>
I'm about to get out of high school, so I decided these were the prime years of my life, so every time I heard somebody say a drug, my heart would skip a beat and I would become happy.  To cut to the chase, I tried coke, thinking that it was going to be fuckin awesome I bought an 8 ball-2.5 grams.  The first time, it took me 3 days to finish it, doing it about once or twice a day. I figured it was no big deal and I wasn't going to buy any more.  Of course- I smoke at least a half ounce of Ganja a week, but I started thinking about how good it felt after I took those big juicy lines of coke.  <BR>
<BR>
After you take a line or two-(I take big ass lines,) you become very satisfied to say the least, talk about phycological shit with a numb throat, and have a warm, racing feeling in your heart.  Once you take a few lines, ten minutes later you want more, and more, and more.<BR>
<BR>
Yesterday I purchased 5 grams for $400.00 bucks.  (I got a gram for free since I bring the bastard so much business.  Well, today, NOT EVEN ONE FUCKING DAY AFTER, IT'S GONE.  I just had to keep doing it and doing it, because after start to come down, you get tired and have the need for more.  Every time I get to the bottom of an empty bag, i go crazy.  Craving for more and more-and the same could happen to you.  I just wanted you to know this so you won't blow your entire lifesavings in a week.  Last week I had 10 grand in the bank, now all I have is 8500-it all went to that damn white shit in the corner of a bag C-O-K-E.<BR>
<BR>
So, ahh, if you got the money, then buy a fuckin kilo for all I care, but if your about to go broke like me- dont even have a thought cross the paths of your mind, and you'll be ok.  Once your there, im pretty sure you're there for good.
