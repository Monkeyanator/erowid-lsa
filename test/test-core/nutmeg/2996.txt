I decided to try nutmeg after observing on erowid.org.  My experience was a complete bomb.  I experienced nothing.  There was a Float Frenzy in my town where everyone makes a float and floats down the river.  Afterwards there is a big party.  I decided to try the nutmeg at the party.  I had a few beers, then went to my car with a buddy of mine.  We had each bought a small container of ground nutmeg.  It was about 1 1/8 ounce (31 grams).  Each of us poured almost all the container into a glass of water.  We stirred it for what seemed like about 5 minutes.  It was 4:20 at the time.  I'm on probation, so I was not smoking reefer.  We gulped down the drink.  It tasted terrible.  <BR>

Right after drinking, we felt...odd.  It was as if everything seemed not quite real.  And that was about the extent of it.  We waited about 2 hours for anything else.  Since nothing else happened we gave up on the nutmeg and started drinking beer again.  But, when I tried, I got terrible heartburn and I couldn't drink.  So, we caught up with another friend and did a couple lines.  The night went on and I didn't feel anything besides the coke and little amount of beer I drank.  So my experience was a flop.  I plan to try it again, with fresher nutmeg.  The kind we used could be bought at any grocery store.  I believe that the brand was 'Sauers'.  Next time I'm going to buy nutmeg and grind it myself and put it in a banana milkshake, I think that should kill the taste.  I'll get back to you on it.  Good luck.
