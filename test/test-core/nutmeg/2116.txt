I worked in a coffee shop for a while and one night I tried the nutmeg experiment. It was about a huge mountainous teaspoonful. Didn't feel a thing all night. Took it in steamed milk at around 8 or 9 in the evening. Nothing. Even smoked before bed and didn't feel any more than just the taste of it in my body. Very oily stuff with an essence all its own.<BR>

Had to work early the next morning and man when I got up was I wasted! Hungover bigtime. Little like an alcohol hangover. But not the same. Definitely affected simple motor coordination, like walking. Not unpleasant or pleasant. Certainly no fun to be at work in such a state. The security guard took a picture of me that morning. I remember it. I look hammered in the picture. Eyes all strung out. They put it on the wall at work and some girl I worked with wrote underneath as a caption, 'Put the bong down and get out of the car slowly.' Ah yes, that universal stoned guilt paranoia expression. Still have that picture somewhere.
