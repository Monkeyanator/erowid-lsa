Well, I was kinda wondering what nutmeg would do, cuz I read some things about it and people say it works.  So I tried it out.  And I must say, it was well worth it.  I ate one tablespoon, and it tasted incredibly bad, but I downed it with some Mountain Dew.  The taste lasted forever, quite annoying.  But within 30 min. I was already feeling a light buzz.  Then I took another tablespoon after 30 min. Things got a lot better then.  I felt like I just smoked some weed, but it was just nutmeg.  I started trippin and thought I was Bob Marley up on stage performing.  <BR>

I was singing to the wall and I could see the audience and everything, that was pretty cool.  My friend was just sittin there laughing at me.  Then I saw cubes everywhere, and the were all colorful and stuff, and then I had a laughing fit about that.  Then I smoked a few bowls of marijuana and things really intensified then.  That was that day, the next day I woke up high.  It was a light buzz, but still was pretty nice.  That lasted most of the day, with me smokin a little weed in between then.  Overall, worth a try. Definitely.  But, my friend had 3 tablespoons and didnt feel anything...I guess it depends on the person. Peace.
