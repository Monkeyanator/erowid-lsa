I noticed the nutmeg FAQ, and decided to give it a shot. Went over to a friends house, we all were extremely skeptical about this. Me my friend boiled down about 30g, then added instant coffee and milk to offset the taste. We both chugged that down. About 3hrs later, I noticed a type of high, very similar to cannabis, as far as the body goes. Everything was funny, things people said, stuff on TV, etc. Later on that evening, I noticed how my friend's head kinded drifted off as a tracer, and then formed a 'negative', kind of like a photograph negative image (very strange). Music sounded great, and it was fun to sing along to whatever was playing(techno sounds pretty good, due to all of the different sounds). The thing that stood out the most was the loss of short term memory, but that was probably why everything was so funny. And the thing about having a feeling of weakness is also true. All in all, it was interesting and fun, and I would probably do it again.
