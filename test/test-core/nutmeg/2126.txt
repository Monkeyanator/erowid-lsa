I tried Nutmeg a few months ago, about 3 Tbsp worth all at once with a cold milk to wash it down. Took about 2 hours to kick in and felt like a big pot buzz but with the dizzyness one gets after drinking too much, very prone to giggle at one point. I have no visuals like say LSD but I did seem to like to view colorful patterns (this book on fractals I have was nice to look at) my short term memory was impared, but not too extreme<BR>

The next day I was in a daze, if any of you out there ever want to try this make sure it's a friday, vacation, or you have extra sick days because I wouldn't suggest you go to work/school after doing nutmeg. I had school the next day, real lousy like walking in your sleep, It wasn't bad per se, but way too much thinking and walking then I was in the mood for.<BR>

but overall I give nutmeg a thumbs up, didn't feel sick once, well I felt ill downing it though .. very icky, the high has it's nice points and when it was over no trouble getting to sleep (prepare to CRASH hard afterwards, and sleep like a log) unlike acid.
