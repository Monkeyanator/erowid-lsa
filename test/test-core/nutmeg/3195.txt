I've used nutmeg a bunch of times in my days..all were positive experiences.  I usually would eat it with ice cream, but after 4 or 5 times of this I would literally start puking just from the smell of it. !!!(nutmeg ISN'T fun to throw up!--usually I go into painful dry heaves first then when it comes up it makes a huge mess)!!!  Usually it would take me around 1 hour to eat the nutmeg I was planning on using.<BR>

Well I read somewhere about how the effects came on much stronger if you ate it all at once..so I decided to put the nutmeg into pills and eat it.  This wasn't as long or as hard as I had previously thought.  The only capsules I could get ahold of were Allegra pills, which are pretty dang big. :)  Anyway, it took me about 15 minutes to make 16 pills of it.  I'm not sure of the exact amount, but it was more than I thought would fit in them(I crammed it in them pretty well).  This brings me to another point.  Nutmeg is a commitment!  Nutmeg is an experience - it's not just for little kiddies who want a totally positive fun time.<BR>

Anyway, I took the pills all at once, and waited.  The first 3-5 hours, nothing but nutmeg burps.  5-8 hours things look funny, laughing at weird things, things started to sounds weird.  Normal nutmeg stuff.  8-12 hours absolutely lost my mind.  I went to bed, fell asleep for 15 minutes, then woke up feeling as though I was falling then hitting something, falling then hitting something..over and over again.  It was so intense - I ended up huddled in a corner covering myself.  Another weird thing was that I felt like I totally lost control of what I was doing with my body, which scared me.  I managed to relax and finally fell into a deep sleep.<BR>

Anyways.  I'm guessing that I took 15 grams considering that I probably only had 20-25g left before I used this dose..and I still had a sizable bit left.  I have taken a whole ounce and never felt this intensity before.  I'm guessing it was taking it all at the same time, and that I didn't take it with anything else, with the exception of an ice cream sandwich to settle my stomach after I took the pills.<BR>

Only 5 - 10 grams of nutmeg is needed before it produces sizable effects...sometimes the most pleasant dose is a low dose considering the wacky effects I got taking a lot of it.
