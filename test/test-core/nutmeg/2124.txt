My buddy Jonny and I studied this one for all of about 20 minutes. We had two options for the nigths fun, being VERY low on cash. It was Dramamine or Nutmeg. Nutmeg was cheaper so we took that route.<BR>

Mixed it with chocolate milk at around 8:30 in a gas station parking lot with a girl we knew. She just watched us and laughed as we gagged. We spent most of the night wondering why the hell it wasn't doing anything. I gave up on it around eleven o'clock and went home and watched tv.<BR>

Then, at maybe midnight, I just felt really stoned. Not the stupid stoned you get with weed, more like a low DXM dose. I went to bed at around 2 am and woke up at 10:30 the next morning.. I was feeling even more wasted than the night before. I started to feel really ill at around 11:45 and went to puke, and then spent the rest of the day in bed, my mom convinced I had the flu. But I laid there in bed stoned and then I started tripping.. mostly CEVs, really weird shit.. like floating lights, that went around in circles. It didn't wear off until maybe 8:30 that night, lingering effects until mignight.. a good 24 hour buzz. I wouldn't recommend it though, not unless you are VERY desperate..
