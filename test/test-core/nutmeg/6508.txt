I just moved across the country (Canada!) and now living in a new province I dont really know too many dealers yet. I was dying to get high, I hadnt for over 2 weeks of being out here in Alberta, and I was feeling this weird anxiety, from the sudden withdrawl. I was looking up some stuff online about shrooms, and came across nutmeg. I was stunned, a common spice could get me so fucked up?! Not sure how to take the drug, I attempted smoking it first, I really didnt want to have to taste that shit. I loaded a bunch into my pipe and lit it up...It kinda tasted like weed, it went down like weed...I felt it in my chest. My eyes started to kinda burn, and they went totally bloodshot..but I was not at all high. <BR>
<BR>
So I decided to try another method. I put some on a mirror, about 2 tablespoons. Made some nice lines, whipped out my nifty snorting device and sucked that shit up. I switched nostrils, just to balance it out...the first 2 lines werent so bad, but then it started to BURN! My eyes were completely blood shot now, watering like a bitch and fuck, did my nose ever hurt. Then the drip came and I couldnt get that taste out of my mouth, I felt so ill, I had so many urges to puke. I drank like, litres and litres of flavoured juices to get that taste out of my mouth, and the smell..fuck!! I lost all urges to get high, and decided that had to have been one of the very stupidest things I had ever done. I learned that lesson and Ill never try that shit again. So for those of you trying to quit doing drugs, when you get the urge to get high, just snort some nutmeg, SICK! Im sticking to weed and shrooms and cocaine and all the shit that doesnt make me wanna die.
