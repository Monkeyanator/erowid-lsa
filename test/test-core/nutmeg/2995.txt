I had this experience a few years ago but i can still remember it very well... One night i was looking online and saw some stuff for nutmeg nad was gonna give it a whirl, i took 3 nuts and nothing happened, then i took another 3 and finally 1 more, after a few hours I was pretty much blasted.  I could not stand up, I could not see straight, I was not sure if I was even alive anymore.  <BR>

At this point in time I thought that nutmeg was even better than LSD or other illegal drugs.  I went to sleep thinking I would be sober in the morning, I wasn't.  I woke up at about 6 am to go to school, and I was still as high as before, i could not look at my mom cause I was afraid she would be able to tell.  I made it to school and can't remember much other than my whole body was numb and I was in a daze.  It felt like I was coming down.  After about 2 hours in school, it kicked in worse.  My friends said I was going crosseyed and I could not stand up without any help.  I was starting to get scared.  I stayed high for the rest of the day and chilled in my room for hours, listening to music which was crazy... <BR>

I went to sleep thinking I would be ok in the morning, but again I was still high! My body was number than before and i had a slight headache, I was coming down.  When I got home from school, I crashed and fell asleep, I slept for over 36 hours straight, and still felt hungover afterwards.  I have done it a few times now and I would have to say that doing more than 5 nuts is crazy (at least for a 135 lb person)
