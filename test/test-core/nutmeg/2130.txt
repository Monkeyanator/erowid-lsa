Doesn't seem likely. I took 24 grams about a week ago, together with two friends, and all of us are still fine. I wouldn't suggest this to anyone, though - it was a bad experience to me. First 1/3 of the high was fine, then things started getting really weird (trails, closed-eyes hallicunations, disortion of time sense and balance), and I got really sick. The next day I slept all day, and then was a bit tired on Monday (I took the (ground) nutmeg at about 4 pm saturday). I was fine on Monday evening and Tuesday.<BR>

Why take Nutmeg you ask? Acid is way better and 100% safe to your body. Acid is probably safer, yes. I have, however, not to date done any illegal drug, and feel that a barrier would be broken if I did one. This is a barrier that I don't really want to break, so I keep to legal highs.<BR>

One night, me and a buddy had been to town, and I got pretty drunk. In addition my love-life went to hell that night (*sob*), so I was more than a little depressed. So when I came home I ate two whole nutmegs, chewed'em, and sat awake for about 2 hours (maybe a little less). No effects, except that I thought the ceiling moved! (Which might be the alcohol, too!). So I went to bed, and slept like a rock!<BR>
<BR>
After about 12 hours of *deep* sleep, my mother came to wake me up.. I felt really awful, but managed to get dressed, and lied down on the couch instead. (BTW, my eyes looked horrible!!! VERY(!!) blood-shot!!) Then I really felt... something! It felt like a strong hash-buzz, accompanied with an strange euphoric feeling.. Very nice indeed, except for the gruesome headache... (Which probably came from the alcohol, as well as the nutmeg). Otherwise I felt great, just lying there, relaxing...<BR>
<BR>
When watching TV my entire vision was somewhat distorted; It seemed like the entire room was interlaced, flickering like crazy... I also had a weird 'reverb' in my head, sounds seemed to echo, although I couldn't hear it!!<BR>
<BR>
The buzz lasted the entire day!! I went to bed, and slept like a baby for about 9-10 hours. The day after I awoke as good as new..<BR>
<BR>
Does anyone have any info on if a nutmeg-buzz is altered when consumed with alcohol?? I had no hallucinations or anything, but I might have slept through that stage... I guess I'll try it again, without drinking! Perhaps in a different dosage, but... I'll keep you informed (if I live through it, that is! :)<BR>

I have seen a few posts here about how people have had bad reactions to nutmeg, etc.<BR>
<BR>
A method I have perfected over the last few years has been to brew the nutmeg into a tea-like drink.<BR>
<BR>
You will need 10-12 nutmegs (whole nuts, not ground, although you can use ground nutmeg if you have a fine strainer). You can buy these in the spice section of lucky's or safeway.<BR>
<BR>
Soak the nutmegs in water overnight, and then cut them into halves. Save the water you soaked them in!<BR>
<BR>
Put the nutmeg halves and about 2 cups of water (use what you soaked them in) in a saucepan. Simmer on low heat for 3-4 hours, (you might need to add a little bit more water as you go). When the water has turned a medium brown color, strain the nutmegs out, let it cool, and then sweeten to taste.<BR>
<BR>
Drink 1-2 cups. <BR>
<BR>
I have experienced mild visual hallucinations, and a definite 'stoned' feeling from this, and never had any adverse effects. I have drank up to 5 or 6 cups of this brew at one sitting, but I have felt effects from just one.<BR>
<BR>
Try this whe taking mushrooms... KAPOW!<BR>
<BR>
In my experience, ground nutmeg, when consumed dry, or dissolved in something else, has some very bad side effects... nausea, vomiting, cramps, and all the other fun stuff.<BR>
<BR>
I hope this helps someone. And if you are intending to flame me for some odd reason, then, burn in a hell of your own devising forever...<BR>

I remember when I was in the Boy Scouts (more years ago than I care to admit) doing a heaping tablespoon full of powdered nutmeg one year at summer camp. I didn't feel anything for an hour or two, but eventually ended up with a very drunken, numb high. The last I could remember was feeling extremely loaded, like a narcotic high, and also beginning to trip. The next thing I knew, my friends were trying desperately to wake me up the next morning. Everyone else had already gotten their stuff packed and ready to go. My friends had managed to keep the adult leaders (one of which was my father) away from my tent and gotten my stuff packed for me. They said I spent most of the night staggering around the camp, rambling incoherently and bitching about my cot being full of gremlins. I was still numb and drugged feeling for a day or two afterword. I don't know how close I was to a lethal dose, but I never tried it again.<BR>

I tried it. I got fresh, whole nutmegs - ground them up as best I could without any sort of utensil to facilitate, and drank about 3 to 4 Tablespoons (let me tell you - it is much easier to put a bit of dry nutmeg in your mouth and wash it down with water, rather than drink soggy nutmeg). About 1 1/2 hours later I started getting a buzz - not too heavy, but noticeable. An hour later, I was totally floored, and crawled in to bed, and fell asleep almost immediately. I woke up four hours later - when I tried to get up the room was spinning horribly, so I put my head back down, and awoke 16 hours later - still with a mild buzz (nut a terribly pleasant one, but not unpleasant, either). I'm going to try it again - this ttime I'll try not to sleep through the peak. My recomendation: try it, but make sure you have lots of time, and no immediate responsabilities. I also suggest that you try it with only one person with you, as it seemed that I was getting rather irritable at the presence of others at the beginning and end of the experience.<BR>

Back in High school, 1970, I used nutmeg three or four times. I believe I took 2 or 3 tablespoons mixed in orange juice. I also took it once again in 1985 with a friend who wanted to try it. Again, same amount in OJ. I remember swallowing it was difficult, and there were alot of nutmeg burps. the trip lasted about a day, and was sort of warped, weird, dreamlike. My friend didn't like it at all. She felt sick. The only thing that makes me nauseous are circular rides at fairs and smoking pot if I'm a little drunk. And I've also thrown up at the beginning of a morning glory trip. Anyway, when I find something I like, I do it alot. (thats why I've stayed away from some drugs) Nutmeg was too much a commitment, for too little alteration. <BR>

After reading a little into the use of NUTMEG as a drug I decided to try it myself. A friend recommended a 10gram dose, so I purchased 3 10gram packets from a supermarket. These sell for about 70cents (australian price). So.......later at my girlfriend's house i downed 1 packet of nutmeg using my 'nutmeg' technique i discovered, which is fill mouth half with water, place a teaspoon of nutmeg in mouth, swish around and SWALLOW! Yerchhhh, tripping is a LITTLE easier....... Anyway, I took it at 6pm, and still later at 9pm I was feeling no effects apart from tiredness. BUT upon waking I felt very strange, like I had gotten stoned about 1 hour before. Hmmmmmm....maybe I didn't sleep enough. Anyway 3 days later I took 2 packets this time, (and also 1/4 bottle of Jim Beam), and 3 hours later I was very tired, so I slept. Again, upon waking I had the same sensation as before, although it seemed much more intense. This lasted the whole day, which made life difficult as I had to study. Anyway this is my experience with nutmeg. I still think getting stoned is better. <BR>

A couple of weeks ago I tried nutmeg.. Mixed about an ounce of the stuff in with some lemonade and guzzled it down.. Tasted like shit. Anyway, nothing happened for about 5 hours. After 5 hours I started to feel something like a minor pot high that got gradually better and ended up not quite as good as pot. Felt high all night, and the next day I still felt it but I also felt kind of sick all day. I don't think I'd do it again, the buzz didn't make up for the sick feeling all day.. Was kind of like a hangover. Maybe I just ate too much.. shrug<BR>

Ok, the active stuff you want is an oil. This is what I did... I extracted the oil and smoked it on a cigarette. Seemed to work. Don't even recall what I used to do the extraction, but acetone will probably work. This is probably a better method of ingestion for the stuff, as it is fairly toxic and you will be able to self-titrate much better smoking rather than eating it.<BR>
<BR>
From my experience, and those of many others, I'd be prone to say 'Don't bother', tho. It wasn't too wonderful, as I recall, and other reports seem to concur.<BR>

Tried nutmeg yesterday, boiled 2 tbs. in a liter of milk. Watched TV and everything they said seemed preposterous. The editing looked *So* strange (Try 'court TV') It had a kind of warm, floaty feeling. <BR>
<BR>
IMHO boiling it in milk is one of the best ways to take this stuff, dosn't taste nearly as nasty, nor does it upset my stomach. That, and sprinkling it on a bunch of marajuana brownies, are my favorite ways of taking nutmeg. (Yes, it enchaces the MJ)<BR>

Well, not wanting to be left out, I tried it myself this past weekend. Consumed approximately 31g and within about an hour or two started to feel pretty good. Was disoriented through most of the next day as well. However, I never got any hangover type effect AT ALL! Maybe I'm just lucky. <BR>

Thougt that you might be interested. There is a lot (well a bit anyway) talk about nut-meg. I have actually got experiences from this 'drug'.<BR>
<BR>
On 3 different occasions I have taken it.<BR>
<BR>
The amount each time was about 20g ground up nut-meg (it doesnt taste verry well .... ....) After a couple of hours the effect was starting to show (we where 3 persons at the time) with euphoria, laughing dissines. After some more hours i got hallucinations in form of the roof opening over my head and letting a strange colourful universe into the room.. After a night sleap I was still fealing a strange unreality sensation. <BR>
<BR>
Hmmmm it lasted about 20-30 hours.<BR>
<BR>
On another session i ate a 'nut' and felt after a few hours like I've been smoking pot (a lot of pot)....<BR>
<BR>
Hmmmm I'm sorry for my poor spelling-abilities, but I hope you will understand it anyway. If you want I can right down a better report....
