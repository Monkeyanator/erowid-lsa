Well I spent a long time reading about nutmeg on this site, and after reading some of the experiences I knew I shoudl try it. Especially since I was grounded and couldnt get any better drugs. So last night I ate, 3 huge ass tablespoons, which probably totaled 30g. I ate thsi around 10:30 and I went to play some video games. It got about 1:30 or so, I didnt feel even the least bit messed up. Nothing happened. So around 2;30 or so I went to bed, disapointed.<BR>

There may be something there, maybe my nutmeg was crappy,I dont know, but right now I feel like I rolled hard as fuck last night. I didnt get sick at all, so I'll probably have to try this again sometime, with some newer possibly better nutmeg.
