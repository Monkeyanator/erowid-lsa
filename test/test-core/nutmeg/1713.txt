I was feeling a bit bored one afternoon and had nothing to do so i decided to give nutmeg a whirl. I went down to the local supermarket and bought 6 nuts for a dollar.  I went home and used a recipe for making a sort of tea out of it.  First i crushed the nuts and put them in 500ml of water and let them simmer. After about an hour I drained the big chunky bits of nutmeg out and mixed a little bit of honey with it to try and get rid of the awful taste. <BR>

After all this i had a little bit more than a cup of this shit, so i thought here goes nothing and skuled the whole lot.  After that I thought i was going to spew my guts up but some how I maneged to hold it back. After about 20mins I started to feel the tinyist bit stoned which lasted about half an hour then i got the worst fucking headache that didn't go away for 2 days.  I would recomend that if you have any brains will won't ever try nutmeg because it's shit and it tastes about the same.
