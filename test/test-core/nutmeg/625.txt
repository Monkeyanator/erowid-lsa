One Saturday evening at about 6:30PM I ingested 3 tablespoons of Nutmeg at my girlfriend's job (she works at a coffee shop so we got the nutmeg out of the backroom).  We planned on attending a rave that night.  At about 8:00PM I started to feel slightly stoned, very much like a tea (marijauna) like high.  Finally by about 11:00PM I very much felt like I was really high on really good tea.<BR>

Finally by about 11:35PM I started to feel like I was rolling on E.  I picked up my girlfriend and our other friend, we were all on nutmeg, and left for the rave.  We arrived there about 12:00AM and waited in line for about 20 minutes, during this whole time I felt like I wasn't high anymore, then we finally got in at about 12:30AM and it was out of control, every 5 minutes I felt like I was in a completely new situation and place and 5 minutes earlier seemed very foriegn.  I danced the night away, having a great time, except my girlfriend was having a hard time adjusting, she was very high from the nutmeg, and a bit concerned, so I spent a lot of time taking care of her, but she got through alright.  <BR>

I think key to doing nutmeg is drinking a lot of water.  By the time I peaked it was an experience much like doing E and smoking marijuana, but much more intense and a little less pleasurable.  I had no visual hallucinations, that i know of, but still it was a very interesting experience.<BR>

As I write this I am on nutmeg again, it is three days later, I am not having as intense an experience, but am only 3 hours into it.  I think a lot of it has to do with environment.  The first time I did it I was at the most out of control rave ever.  This time I'm at home.  Anyway, it's worth trying, so if you are into new experiences I suggest doing nutmeg.  But don't waste this unique high, go out and do something.  Experience as much as you can, I suggest doing it a few hours before you go to a rave, and take caffiene pills.  I had a great time.  As Allen Ginsburg said about LSD, 'Every person over 14 should try this once in their life.'  I suggest the same of nutmeg.  I want to do it in the desert, it sounds interesting.
