I've tried nutmeg once. I took a around three tablespoons, and nothing happened for about NINE HOURS. <BR>
<BR>
I felt a little different, sort of 'heavy' for a while and for about 30 minutes or so, I would get these strange flashes where it would intensify for 10-20 seconds. During those periods, it felt like there was a plane (the flat kind) rotating around in my head. Very peculiar feeling.<BR>
<BR>
When I closed my eyes, I would get very, very mild visuals--slightly swirling and moving colors that weren`t as bright as one gets with pot, and they weren't 3d like pot visuals are.<BR>
<BR>
I didn`t have any nausea or other ill effects.<BR>
<BR>
All in all, it was a worthless experience. You have to choke the shit down, and it takes forever to do anything, and it didn't do much (at least to me).
