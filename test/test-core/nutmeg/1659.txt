My boyfriend and I read a lot about nutmeg and its supposed effects and decided to try it one night.  Both of us have had quite a bit of experience with various drugs, and were feeling mentally up to the challenge. <BR>
<BR>
We each took about half of the smallest tub available of nutmeg and mixed it into about 8 oz. cold milk with some sugar, hoping to mask the taste (which we had heard was awful).  We decided to chug the mixture to avoid tasting it too long, and as I raised the glass to drink, I was almost overwhelmed by the scent of the nutmeg.  It was very pungent smelling, so I held my breath and swallowed about half the mixture.  I immediately gagged and had to swallow hard for about 10 minutes before i could go on.  Much spitting and hacking ensued, and my tongue and lips were completely numb.  This is the most vile and horrible thing I have ever tasted in my life and the nausea afterward made my stomach visibly churn.  It tasted intensely like the scent of cloves and burned my mouth and throat when I ingested it.<BR>
<BR>
Not to be daunted by the flavor and scent, I drank 3/4 of the glass before I could not go on.  My boyfriend drank his entire glass.<BR>
About an hour later, I started to feel really stuffy, like you do when you get a bad head cold and feel disoriented and disjointed.  I started feeling kind of high, a tiny little bit like pot makes me feel, but that only lasted 30 minutes.  In an hour and a half, I felt as though I was being smothered, my skin was thick and heavy, I was groggy, and i just wanted to sleep.  I started to feel really nauseous ( we had eaten a light lunch about 3 1/2 hours before we drank the mixture) and was puking sometime close to the 1 1/2 hour point.  My boyfriend did not puke (he has a much stronger stomach and weighs about 30 lbs. more than me) but felt all the rest of the effects I was feeling.<BR>
<BR>
After about 3 hours of feeling drowsy and lethargic I went to bed, and slept fitfully and had intense stomach pain until I finally threw up again.  I woke the next morning with a headache and the determination to never do this again.
