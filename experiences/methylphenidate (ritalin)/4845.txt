This is the third time I've submitted this report, so here I try again.<BR>

I've done ritalin many times, many different dosages, but 60 mgs was the usual amount I did at a time, when that wore off, I'd do 20 more mg's or so until I decided it was time to go to sleep or I ran out. Sometimes if I had a good amount of tabs, I would do as much as 150 mgs at once. I always crushed the ritalin tabs and snorted them, or sometimes I would crush up the tabs and 'chase the dragon' with them, which actually does work.<BR>
<BR>
I usually get ritalin in large amounts, 2 or more bottles, I do not have a prescription, but I get it for free from friends. After I am done with about 2 bottles, I will fiend for it for about a month later, and then I'll forget about it. <BR>

The moral is, ritalin is a good buzz, but like other amphetamines and amphetamine-esque drugs, it is addicting.
