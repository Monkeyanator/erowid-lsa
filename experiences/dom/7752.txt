4:30pm. White powder in a capsule, ingested orally, known to be 6mg DOM. Setting was a largish private party (~50 ppl) outdoors and indoors, featuring live music and freaky halloween costumes. My partner ingested a similar amount at the same time.<BR>

I feel the slightest effects at T+30 minutes; at T+1 hour I can definitely feel it working: mood elevation mostly.  Then i notice the colors! The trees are magnificent! Well, aren't they always? But more so than usual :). The body load is negligible. I play some baseball, socialize a little, cook dinner. Eating food at T+3 (approx.) feels good. I'm actually hungry, which is unusual for me on psychedelics. Definitely in a nice zoomy headspace, nothing is too intense and it all feels good.<BR>

Socialize at party for the next few hours. At T+7 I can definitely tell that I've come off a peak of a very gradual sort. It's a gradual flow to baseline over the next few hours. I fall asleep at T+11 hours.<BR>

For the next two mornings, it's really difficult to wake up.
