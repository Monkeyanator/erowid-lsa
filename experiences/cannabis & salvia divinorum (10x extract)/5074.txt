Before I start let me note that I have been on over the counter decongestants for a couple days leading up to, and including, this one. Earlier in the day I had tried to smoke Salvia 10x extract twice (I had about an 1/8th of a gram both times) to no avail. The second time I kind of got a drunk feeling, but that's about it. I remembered talking to my friend (an experienced Salvia user), and he said that he was stoned his first time using Salvia and he tripped.<BR>

I packed a bowl of weed, and slowly toked it away. High, I stumbled around and loaded my pipe almost full of the Salvia extract (I had pre-measured it to be roughly 1/8 of a gram), and took one huge toke, the whole time keeping the flame on the Salvia. It hadn't started to kick in, so I toked again, and before I could even exhale I felt a strong force trying to pull me down. I quickly placed my pipe down on my table before the force pulled me down to the ground. This is where it all starts. The most recent Salvia trip story I had read was 'Disney Themed Trip' by Pup, and accordingly it molded my first Salvia hallucination. I was Goofy, the lovable Disney character, and I was in a race car. I was suddenly in a big race track, and the same blue colored cartoon face was surrounding me, then I started racing. I was driving my car quickly around the track, and then for an instant the hallucination dropped and I could tell I was really just going around really quickly on my knees all across the bottom floor of my house. <BR>

I stood up, and all of a sudden I was a slob from the Mafia, asking some cigar smoking guy 'You wanna piece of this?' Seeing the cigar made me want to smoke, and the hallucinations once again dropped enough for me to tell what was really going on. I went outside, and lit a cigarette, and I was almost instantly transformed into a punk waiting to catch the bus at a Seattle bus stop. When I realized this wasn't the case, I went back inside, not wanting the neighbors to see me, and I lay down on the couch, where I got my final, quickest (seemed like minutes, but most not have been), and most strange hallucination...I was a lesbian porn star. I'm not kidding. I was in the middle of a sex scene, and there were cameras all around.<BR>

After this, there were no more hallucinations, although I did find it hard to think quickly for another 20 minutes or so. I believe the trip lasted about 20 minutes, but I could easily be mistaken. All I know is that it lasted at least five, because I smoked almost a full cigarette. My first trip with Salvia was extremely enjoyable, and I plan to do it again.
