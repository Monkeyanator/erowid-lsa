Although this was not the first time that I smoked pot, it was the first time that I had ever smoked opium.  I had just gotten over not  sleeping for a while and I was at a party.  A few guys and I split the blunt which had some black tar in it.<BR>

Possibly the most memorable thing about the experience was the fact that I actually felt intelligent.  I was actually carrying on whole elaborate arguments and the such.  I felt more clear headed than I ever had before.  That is the most amazing thing about the opium.  I  was 'fucked up' as some would say, but I didnt feel that way.  It felt as if all things were clear and everything would be ok.  I was irritable earlier in the day, but then all ill thoughts were lost to the opium which just filled me with some sort of strange joy.  <BR>

Since this experience, I have tried 'White Rock' as well.  I recommend the tar opium for a more intuitive and 'heady' high.  The White Rock did mess me up, but I do not like it as much because it doesn't open up anything in the mind, nor does it taste as good as tar.
