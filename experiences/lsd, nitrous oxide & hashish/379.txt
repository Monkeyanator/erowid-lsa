In my height of drug experiences some of my friends and i got lucky with a lot of different drugs one evening. Some coming from some girls we knew and some from a city nearby, and the nitrous from a local hospital. I got ahold of some strong wet blotter with felix the cat inprinted on it and dosed on the way to the private party. We had the tank in the back of the truck and i had a small bit of hash that i got from a local chick that was cool. The hash was kinda sweet tasting and was a nice change from weeks of weed smoking. We arrived with alot of energy from the acid and smiles all around. <BR>

Needless to say we were all pretty excited,and as the night went on we played frisbee in the field next to my friends house with chem. Lights that we cracked open and rubbed on the frisbee so we could see it at night and get those crazy tracer's thats fun to see.I took a break and remembered the nitrous we had and got a couple of friends that helped me lift it off the truck and drug it to the porch. We all had our ballons and i mean the kind you blow up to make a punching bag out of. We filled it up and from that nitrous and hash mix the visuals were so intense that i am not sure if any of us knew that we were all still there.<BR>

Time seemed to hit at a perfect pace and we were all very happy. The beer took of the edge so there was no ego defining crap that usally happens any time alot of people are tripping together. Then right when everything seemed perfect we all heard a loud crack and looked and we saw the nitrous tank had fallen over and it seemed to be expelling violently onto my friend's leg. We all weren't sure what to do. it's like nothing that we saw was making sense even my friend that it was burning i don't think relized it as fast as he should have. Once we got our minds together my friend with this enormous freezing burn was gettin up and trying to understand his injury, well we went inside and tried to get a wash cloth that was wet but neither warm or cold and press it against the burn. it looked wierd his leg in this spot was like goo. After this happening we calmed each other down and went outside to strap the tank up to a tree so maybe if we fell down it wouldn't. We didn't let it kill the evening but i truly could see how when you are so blown away by multipal drugs how easy it is to get lost in your mind even if you are a experienced recreational user....<BR>
