First i found that my buddy has a Rx for it and he gave me some sayin it was pretty good. It is a stimulant so only take it in the morn. It lasts a helluva a long time like adderall.  It felt a warm euphoria in my chest which lasts for a very short time. It made me feel content wit everything, but the shitty part is like Adderall it comes  down really hard and long.<BR>

You should never waste any $$ on this at all.. it really isnt that great. Its nice to have at school or work maybe.. its worth at least tryin but dont take anymore than like 5 of them.  You'll never goto sleep and youll feel like shit.
