<!--300 mg recreational dose Zoloft--><BR>
<BR>
I was having a bad day at work and nothing seemed to be going right. A friend of mine told me about a perscription drug that she takes and it always put her in a good mood. So she gave me a few of them and I took them. I had never taken any kind of perscription drugs before so I didn't know what to expect. So after I took them I waited for something to happen, but nothing did.<BR>

When I got home from work a few hours later I became very tired, alomst to the point where I couldn't stay awake. I tried 4 times to get up but I just wanted to sit. So eventually I got up and went to my friends house. Everyone there said I looked like shit and wondered what was wrong with me. I told them that I took zoloft at work. So we decided to go out and smoke a few blunts. I remember feeling very strange and told all of my friends how this was the weirdest high I had ever gotten. I felt as if there was another level of existance around me, and I wasn't sure where I was. A friend of mine decided to give me a shottie and that's when everything started. He blew me up and I started coughing redicously so I had to sit down. I sat on a bench right in front of a lake. directly in front of me was a bush which I kept staring at. It was about 9 at night and it was dark, but everything seemed to be getting lighter and lighter. I remember looking around and being very confused. The place we were in was very dark and surrounded by trees. It seemed like it was the middle of a beautiful day and there was so much sunlight. Suddenly I began to see another view. A little  wedge was coming into my view. inside this wedge was the way things really looked. Dark and scary looking. And the rest was all so beautiful.Everything was so peaceful.I started zoning out and staring into the bush. When ever I would stare at it and be in this certain spot and position I would feel absolutly amazing. Almost as if there was nothing bad in the world. As long as I looked at that one spot everything was great. By this time all of my friends thought I was absolutely insane. I began to enter a meditational period. I sat there and tried to just clear my mind. After about 10 minutes of trying I did. I was in a trance for about 17 minutes. All I saw in my mind was a big white open space. I was able to look around in my mind but everything was just white. I had no idea what was going on around me. I didn't really care. I was so peaceful. All of a sudden things started to appear in my mind. The bench I was sitting on appeared beneth me. Then my friends started to appear around me. Then the sky and trees started appearing and before I knew it I was back and out of my meditation. Everyone was asking me what the hell was going on and I told them that I felt amazing. At that moment one of my friends walked across my line of sight blocking my spot and what I saw. Instantly I became furious and started yelling. The second the person moved I was fine again. Another friend of mine put head phones over my ears and started playing techno. I instantly spaced out and started seeing crazy closed eye visuals. Lots of spirals and different patterns. The second he would take them off I would stop seeing things and the second he put them back on it would start again. So after about an hour and a half we decided to leave from where we were. As I was walking I saw what I was looking at in my spot, not what was actually infront of me. Eventually after we left I started to come out of what ever it was that was going on. The next day when I woke up I felt great. I was in such a good mood, and people kept remarking how happy I was. <BR>
