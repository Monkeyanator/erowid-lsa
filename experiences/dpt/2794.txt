It was about 2:00 in the afternoon on a sat. I snorted this weird drug over at my friends house whom gave it to me, about 10 min after I felt strange and went home. when I got there I puked on the floor and then in the bathroom. right after it felt almost like I was tripping, I started having the best visuals I have ever had. I tried to enjoy it but I felt very sick the whole time,I lifed my shirt up and It looked like my skin was bubbling and turned purple. <BR>

one of my other friends came over and asked what was wrong I told her I felt like I was going to die so she checked my pulse and it was normal. later I saw a four dimensional world where inbetween the space of the walls in the house I saw almost like spirits flowing around in the room, also I kept on seeing floating crosses going in circles everywhere in the room.<BR>
after about one hour the visuals went away and I felt like I had alot of energy and was able to leave my house without fear. I went up to the park and met my friend who gave it to me and we talked about it. I wouldnt ever do it again, but I do reccomend trying it If you can handle your drugs.
