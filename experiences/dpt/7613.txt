I have begun my series of experiments with DPT insuff.  I'm two trials in : 100mg last week, 150mg last night.  I feel like I haven't had the 'real dose' yet.  I take the high end of dosages for most substances.<BR>
<BR>
It was strangely acid like in feel last night. Not super visual, but it felt hummy.  There are some features to it that I need to adapt to : it's a *very* light powder, and I over-insuff it.<BR>
<BR>
So I irritate the roof of my mouth and the top/back of my throat (it's pretty irritating as chems go, though not in 2cb's class certainly)<BR>
It all felt very anticipatory, as if at some point I was going to really trip hard, but that never came.<BR>
<BR>
Some muscle issues ... my neck has been a little sore all day, and I've noticed a tendency to cramping today (the day afterward).  I didn't notice any of that though, during the trip. What is clear to me is that I've been doing a 'social dose'.  Having other trippers around would have been a good thing. I wanted to talk to people.<BR>
<BR>
I can see it being a fun chem at that dose. Being able to trip for just an hour or two with friends.<BR>
<BR>
[e] any other body load during? like stomach, muscle tensions, etc?<BR>
<BR>
I had some stomach oddities. It wouldn't have been surprising if I'd vomited. Some of that was tryptamine rush type stuff, some was how bad DPT smells. And tastes.<BR>
<BR>
[e] how long was the coming up phase with it?<BR>
<BR>
I noticed, however, that the nausea was especially tied to getting up and trying to walk around. I had thought I was done, got up, and suddenly my stomach said 'Sit.'  I didn't have any uncontrollable shivers or anything. Although 'jiggling' felt good. (Shaking my leg sort of intentionally, but in a way that my body wanted it to shake. -- Terrible explanation --<BR>
Its sort of like a nervous energy shaking of the leg.)<BR>
<BR>
Muscle tension was noticeable after the trip was basically over. It's hard to say how long the coming up was, because I don't feel like I really got 'up'.  Like I couldn't find a place on a timeline and say 'I was up right there.'  However, it was pretty brief before I was getting alerts, and I guess not long after that that I plateued. 10 minutes? 15 minutes?<BR>

Experiment #3, 200 mg DPT HCl Insufflated<BR>
<BR>
T+0 [GS] 200mg DPT Insufflated.<BR>
T+1 [GS] I used an uncut straw to minimize the oversnorting effect, that seems to have worked somewhat.<BR>
T+2 [GS] Though the irritation on the roof od my mouth is ... irritating.<BR>
T+3 [GS] The smell and taste are both enough to induce naseous thoughts.<BR>
T+3 [e] a sort of allergic feeling? itchy mouthroof?<BR>
T+4 [GS] It's hard to draw a line to 'allergic feeling'.<BR>
T+4 [GS] It's something that the sensitive flesh on the roof of my mouth doesn't want to touch.<BR>
T+4 [GS] And so it feels like ... hmm.<BR>
T+5 [GS] Do you know how the roof of your mouth, when you've got a bad cold, can be really sore from vigorous attempts at snuffling out of your nose into your mouth?<BR>
T+5 [GS] It feels like that.<BR>
T+6 [GS] My nose is plasm-ing like it does from 2cb. I'm starting to feel a certain amount of extra hummmmm in my nervous system.  Not mental or emotional, strictly physical feeling.<BR>
T+8 [GS] Slightly depressed breathing. A brief wave of nausea. It takes an effort to focus my mind on a task. Like holding up my end of multiple conversations.<BR>
T+10 [GS] IRC becomes a special challenge. Which, of course, was the reason for the caret scale in the first place.<BR>
T+10 [GS] Okay, a lot of physical nervous energy.<BR>
T+10 [GS] Fast onset.<BR>
T+14 [GS] Just noticed some visuals. Yes, but Not obtrusive.<BR>
<BR>
T+45 [GS] Okay, a lot of nervous physical energy just went. <BR>
T+45 [e] sounds good (?)<BR>
T+45 [GS] Yes good.<BR>
T+45 [e] accompanied by a commensurate drop in mental effect?<BR>
T+45 [GS] Hard to say. I would guess yes. A drop, maybe.<BR>
<BR>
T+1:25 [GS] So I am clearly on the backside of this.<BR>
T+1:25 [GS] And have been for maybe 10 minutes. There's still some minor stuff going on, but it feels all over.<BR>
T+1:25 [e] where are the visuals at? look at the ceiling, any strong movement / color shifts?<BR>
T+1:25 [GS] Nope, nothing strong.<BR>
T+1:26 [GS] All that's left is a feeling of slight intoxication.<BR>
T+1:27 [e] any significant mood lift during the middle?<BR>
T+1:28 [GS] Yes.<BR>
T+1:29 [GS] But I wish it had all been more overwhelming.<BR>
T+1:30 [e] yeah, you're pushing the dose up there pretty high.  Thats a lot of powder.<BR>
T+1:30 [GS] Once again, it felt rather LSD like.<BR>
T+1:31 [GS] Except now. Now it feels ... well, sort of unlike other things. But very low level.
