Set: Very natural, friday evening, feeling good.<BR>
Setting: My apartment<BR>
<BR>
11:00pm <BR>
7mg of 5-Meo-DIPT was dissolved in water & drank, the taste was pretty bad but i gulped it in one shot.<BR>
I had eaten a medium sized dinner 3 hours ago, and felt most of it was digested.<BR>
<BR>
11:20pm<BR>
First alerts are noticeable, this is my first time trying the Foxy, and the coming up first felt a little like the coming up of MDMA, than it changed to a feeling like a small dose of acid. Minor visuals were noted, mostly slight breathing of objects, but required attention to be seen.<BR>
<BR>
11:40pm<BR>
This is quite mild, I had an acid trip two days ago and it's probably causing some cross-tolerance. It seems that the trip has peaked, and i begin to have a slight stomach upset, but not really nausea.<BR>
I smoke a bowl of medium grade weed and that makes things a bit more visual and also calms down my stomach.<BR>
<BR>
00:00am<BR>
I get online for a short period of time to say some hellos. There is a weird body load that feels more like a mental tension oriented thing, than an actual body load. I smoke another bowl and things are getting much more mellow & nice. perma-grin has set in :)<BR>
<BR>
00:15am<BR>
I weight out 15mg of 2-CT-7, divide it into three small lines, and snort one of the lines. The burn is bad, burns pretty much like hell itself - but it's probably intensified because of the foxy in action. My eyes got really runny & red. The 15 minutes after snorting the line were bad, my nose & throat were burning, my eyes tearing, and generally wasn't feeling to good physically. After about 15 minutes the burn started to subside, but it took another 15 minutes or so so completley go away. As the burn was beginning to subside, I started noticing some patterning of colors in the air & much more noticeable breathing effects.<BR>
<BR>
Just as the effects were rising I got pretty nauseous, and went into the bathroom to puke what was left undigested of my earlier meal. The purge wasn't bad at all, it actually flowed very freely. After the purge I still felt a bit nauseous, so I smoked another bowl to calm my stomach. Perfect solution.<BR>
<BR>
00:45am<BR>
I was wondering what should I do with the remaining 10mg. I was very turned off by the idea of snorting the rest, as the burn was pretty much the worst I have ever felt. The trip at this point wasn't going really strong, just some nice patterning effects and breathing - I wanted more than that!. after thinking about that for several minutes I decided to take the remains orally. given the fact I was already tripping nicely, and with the addition of the Foxy earlier, I thought this would be enought.<BR>
<BR>
01:00am<BR>
Went outside to smoke a cigarette. Outside it was a bit chilly, and as I sat there, smoking a cigarette, lightnings were visible all over around the place, which was nice because i like thunderstorms, and it's only the second time it rains this year.<BR>
<BR>
I was listening to some ambient collection on my minidisc, and the combination of both drugs very intensified the music, i felt pulled into the music.  As I was quiet stoned I decided to stay outside and finish listening to the disc. As the cd was about to end the lightnings were getting more & more often in duration, and the thunderclaps where much more audioable - it still wasn't raining here, but it was pretty obvious that would occur at some point later. Finally the disc was over & I came back inside.<BR>
<BR>
02:00am<BR>
I spend some time just lying in bed & listening to psy-trance, which also sounded spectacular. I dance for a few minutes and it feels good, but slightly clumsy, probably because of the weed.<BR>
<BR>
02:45am<BR>
The peak effects of both the Foxy and snorted 2-CT-7 are over, and now it's almost 2 hours since digestion of the extra 10mg, and although from <BR>
time to time I get this feeling it might be starting to come up, nothing really noticeable happens. I decide to wait another half an hour before reaching any conclusions about what's going on.<BR>
<BR>
03:15am<BR>
two and a half hours since digestion of the supplement, and it isn't coming up. Another case of a dreaded underdose.  I was quite put down because of this, and decided to make a nice smoke-down, which consisted of 4 bowls, and a big joint of hash.<BR>
<BR>
04:00am<BR>
Feeling very stoned and very sleepy, but also quite hungry - due to the weed. I wander to the kitchen and gobble down some belgian chocholate which tastes absolutley awesome. Just as i finished eating and headed back to my bedroom in order to get some sleep, a loud thunderclap was heard outside, and rain started pouring pretty heavily. Now, my bedroom is located in the attic, so rain makes alot of noise falling directly on my roof, and due to my enhanced hearing, sleep became quite impossible. I just layed in bed for about 1.5-2 hours until the rain had stopped.<BR>
<BR>
06:00am<BR>
The sun was just starting to rise. I wen't outside to have a cigarette & watch the sunrise, which was a beautiful thing, with all the black clouds around, the scene was very beautiful and i enojoyed it for close to half an hour, and then finally went inside to finally get some sleep. I had some difficulties falling asleep, but after some time i managed to fall asleep. Sleep itself wasn't really good, and woke up at about 11:00am, feelling pretty much unrested, but mentally fine. I was a bit sleepy for most of the day, but had a good night's sleep the night after.<BR>
<BR>
Generally the trip was a disappointment, because of the underdose, but the foxy seemed to be pretty nice substance, and I can't wait to try it at a higher dose on it's own.<BR>
<BR>
Peace
