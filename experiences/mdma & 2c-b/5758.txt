A few weeks ago, we could get 4 pills of 2C-B!  We had read the reports here on Erowid about the effect of this stuff and were very much in the mood to try it once, but it was very difficult to get.<BR>
<BR>
We started with 100mg E (1 pill of which we know the content exactly). After 40 minutes, the effect already started to kick in on me (normally after 90 minutes) and at about 75 minutes, my wife came 'up' and we layed down next to each other (naked).<BR>
<BR>
After two hours from start, we boosted with another half E-pil (50mg MDMA) experiencing a nice E-trip. (In the beginning, we just had a little sex with each other, but soon preferred to just lay down and relax, hug and kiss and just be pretty much 'loved-up').<BR>
<BR>
After about 4 hours from start, we thought about the 2C-B pills and took 1/2 pil each (=10mg 2C-B). Without thinking about anything on special, after 30 minutes I suddenly recognized an unexpected reaction down between my legs.  I was prepared!!!  (Without even thinking about sex!)  And I was WELL prepared!!  Amazing!  We'd read something about this effect of 2C-B, but this was really amazing! Should it be called Viagra??? So we went for it (of course!!!!)  <BR>
<BR>
After a (busy) while, we layed down again, waiting for some halucinations, reported to the use of 2C-B. But probably, the amount we'd taken was not enough (only 10mg) and we didn't have any of such. <BR>
<BR>
But we did get the feeling, as if the MDMA effects had worn off by the 2C-B or better, we experienced some sort of a JoJo-effect. Up - down - up - down -...<BR>
<BR>
At the end we became very restless and felt kinda woken-up and we lost the mood for just to lay there. We also started to feel very tired and exhausted. So finally (after 5 hours from start) we decided to go to bed early to get a good rest. <BR>
<BR>
Unfortunately, once in bed, we couldn't get to sleep for the next hours...<BR>
<BR>
Except for the aphrodisiac effect of the 2C-B, we didn't like it that much as a pure MDMA experience...
