IMyself, my girlfriend (T), and a friend of ours (S) all piled into the car, equipped with an assortment of substances for the night. We were heading for Glenelg, a town on the shoreline not far from our houses.<BR>
<BR>
On the way, myself, and friend S, had a few (2 or 3) drinks to loosen us up for the forthcoming night. T obstained as she was driving.<BR>
<BR>
Upon arrival, myself and S, smoked a few cones of some Cannabis I had come across earlier in the week, and T had a few drinks. Ten minutes later, we were both reasonably high, so I then pulled out the little bottle of Rush which I had stashed away, and convinced S to try it with me.<BR>
<BR>
It was his first time, and it was amusing to watch the suprised look upon his face, as we both felt that rush, come up from our body and shrink our heads. The effects were much more pleasant that normal for me, mainly due i suppose to the cannabis.<BR>
<BR>
After the rush had gone (2 mins later) we debated as to weither we should do the speed now, or later, as the night was fairly early. I won the debate and convinced them that we should go for a walk first, to check out the beach party.<BR>
<BR>
We all went for a walk which lasted about 30mins, inpecting the state of the party which was starting to crank already, and watching as hundreds of ppl poured into the main street, all headed for the party.<BR>
<BR>
By the time we returned to the car, i was starting to come down from the weed, so i decided that we might as well do the speed.<BR>
<BR>
T and I were the only ones doing it, as S had never tried it before, and we weren't going to pressure him into anything. I watched as T lined it up on a CD case, and though of how it reminded me of the first time we met (but that is another story).<BR>
<BR>
She proceeded to snort 2 lines through a straw (courtesy of McDonalds), and then passed the CD case to me. I snorted one line, and then mixed about 2 more into a bottle of water i was carrying.<BR>
<BR>
About 10 - 15 mins later, on the way back to the beach party, i felt it starting to kick in, so we headed to the closest shop, to grab some gum. We sat in the shop for about 5 mins as S ate some food. By that time i stuffed the entire packet of gum in my mouth, as I couldnt stop chewing.<BR>
<BR>
The night was amazing, i had never ever felt so good on speed before, i had the energy to do *anything*, and i felt as though i was just a pair of eyes, floating around, i couldnt even feel my legs !!<BR>
<BR>
By the end of the night (5 hours later), T and i were not feeling so good, it was as if i had a bad bad case of the flu. I felt all cold and shaky, and had some intense nausea. It seems that all that euporia wasnt without its bad side.<BR>
<BR>
On the way home, i drank around litres of water, which helped to ease the shaky cold feeling.<BR>
<BR>
I was on anti-depressants at the time(SSRI Cipramil), but the only effect i have ever noticed from them, was to give the stoned feeling more of a 'trippy' edge.<BR>
<BR>
All in all, it wasnt a bad night, but if i did it again, i would definately leave the cannabis to last, to ease the effects of the speed.
