I lived in this wonderful house back in 1999 that had all sorts of herbs and things growing in our huge yard. The lady that lived there before said that there were fairies living in the garden and that they made the plants grow in the 'right way'. I never saw the fairies, but a friend and I were sitting in our courtyard one day looking at all the plants. The only one I could remember (that she had told us about) was the wormwood bush. <BR>

We decided to take some bong hits, ok A LOT of bong hits, of some wormwood to see what it would do. Neither of us had any connections with a pot dealer or anything like that so we tried what we could find. After smoking about 6 bowls or so a piece -- man that stuff burned -- we both sat in our courtyard and talked about whatever. About maybe 5 minutes later our conversations got deeper and more intricate. We both had the same feelings of being EXTREMELY mellow. I kept zoning out on sounds and it seemed like the world was twisting together in some kind of symphonic dissonance that carried me with it. We then decided it was time to break out our next-door-neighbor's homemade wine (65 proof! and tasted intense but mellow). The rest of the day was kind of a haze but it was lots of fun.<BR>

Another time we tried to make tea out of the wormwood -- I eventually used up a whole honey bear in a cup of that stuff and STILL couldn't drink it. <!--There ended up being lots of herbs there like Jimson Weed, Wormwood, Belladonna, Lettuce Opium.....and others but the neighbor (landlord) mowed them all down before we could try some of them.-->
