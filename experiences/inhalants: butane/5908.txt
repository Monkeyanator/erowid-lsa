It was only my second time huffing Butane.  (The first time I tried it, it didn't do anything to me.)  I was driving and huffing at the same time.  The Butane made me pass out, and when I woke up I was in a car wreck.  I was on the wrong side of the road, my car and the other car were totaled, and there were ambulances and police cars everywhere.  When I first came to, I had no idea where I was or what was going on, and I was in so much pain I couldn't move.  It all felt like a really, really bad dream, and I wish it was...<br/>

The paramedics put a neck-brace on me, put an 'oxygen-tube' in my nose, put me on a stretcher, and took me to the hospital.

My collarbone and part of my chest were burned and bruised from my seatbelt (but I'm glad I was wearing it).  I wasn't hurt very seriously, but I was lucky.  <br/>
I found out that the other car was being driven by a 17-year-old girl, and her little brother had been in the passenger seat.  They didn't die, but they were hurt worse than I was.  I felt so bad, and so stupid.  I never meant to hurt anybody...
