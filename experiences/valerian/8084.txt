Ive lately developed insomnia.  And being the little herbalist that I am, I decided to try out Valerian due to good results that seem to be gained.  So I went to the local drug store and bought 530 mg capsules.  I consumed 2 the first night and I had the greatest sleep of my life.  It was very deep and I was very refreshed in the morning.  There were slight side effects such as continued drowsiness throughout the day but ive found that ginseng or Guarana clears it right up.  I highly recommend this for people with anxiety problems or/and insomnia.
