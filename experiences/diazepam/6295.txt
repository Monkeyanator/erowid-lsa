I have recreationally used Valium on numerous occasions in doses ranging from 10mg up to 50mg.  Here are my conclusions:<BR>
<BR>
- In doses of 10-20mg, Valium generally produces a mild euphoric buzz with a sense of calm, relaxtion, sedation and mild muscle relaxant qualities.  <BR>
<BR>
- At doses higher than 20mg, I find that the buzz becomes too heavy & sedating to enjoy - I just have a tendency to want to go to sleep.<BR>
<BR>
- Using alcohol & Valium in combo seems to just create a greater depressant effect.  A couple of drinks with a low dose of Valium - 10mg - seems OK & a sensible limit to observe.  However, combining Valium with alcohol is a risky proposition.  LARGE quantities of alcohol & Valium in combination could be serious - coma or even death in some cases.<BR>

-  One negative thing I would point out about Valium is the after effects.  I find that Valium, especially if used fairly regularly (several times a week), tends to build up in your system.  In technical terms, Valium has a half-life of approx. 40 hours and the major metabolite of Valium - desmethyldiazepam - has a half-life of 100 hours.  In laymans terms this means that Valium will hang around in your system, causing subtle active effects for several days after taking the drug.  What I find is that this causes a sense  of mild depression and a mild dulling of the senses which lasts for about 3-5 days. However, I know others who use Valium who say that they do not perceive any depressive/dulling effects at all. Your mileage may vary ...
