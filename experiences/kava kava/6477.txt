First of all, for all you thinking of doing kava kava, a few weeks ago i bought a 72 pills bottle. Each pill 150mg with 30% kavalactones. At first, I took around 6-7 pills expecting an opiate like buzz. Nothing happened. I knew it took a few tries and for a whole week, i had some everyday, around 10 pills a per day and NOTHING AT ALL. Not even the mildest buzz. Please do yourself a favor and do not spend any money on this crap. I may be wrong about kava, but the kava kava i bought did not have any feeling at all. Do not buy it.
