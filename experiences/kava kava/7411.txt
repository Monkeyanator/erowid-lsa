Last night in desparation for pot (and a lack thereof) I decided that I would try to smoke some Kava Kava.<BR>
<BR>
I took a capsule of pure kava kava that I bought a a local health store, broke it open, and poured it into a normal tobacco pipe that I fitted with a screen.<BR>
<BR>
I took two hits and was unable to finish the rest.  The effects were like being stoned, only with much more awareness and a sort of inner peace.  I also experienced mild hallucinations where the folds of my blanket kept turning into small furry animals.  The most amazing part was the complete lack of paranoia.  I felt like everything was at peace and that life was, for some reason, making sense.  <BR>
<BR>
After enjoying the mild trip for a little while, I began to meditate.  I found this hard to do because everything I looked at was so interesting and vivid.  After about 15 minutes of hard focusing, I went into a sort of trance where I pictured myself floating up above myself.  The imagination was greatly enhanced.  Then about and hour later I returned out of meditation and fell immediately asleep.  For a person who suffers insomnia, this is just short of incredible.  Not even pot would put me to sleep.<BR>
<BR>
In short, smoking kava kava has made for the most relaxed that I've ever been in my life.  The drug doesn't by any means make me feel happy.  But I found that I was able to focus and feel at peace.  The best part is, for a broke college student, that it's way sheaper then most anything and readily available at the grocery store.  Also, the 'high' lasted a lot longer, granted the euphoria did not.  I woke up this morning feeling completely relaxed and now, almost 10 hours later, I still feel focused and relaxed.
