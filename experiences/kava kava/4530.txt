I was at a dull new years eve party and I had brought the contents of 50 of the CVS gelcaps to the party.  The GelCaps are filled with a foul smelling grainy powder.  I decided to open all of them up one night and pour the powder into a baggie for easier transportation.  At the party I decided to make myself a 'cocktail' by mixing the kava kava powder from inside the gelcaps with some chocolate flavored Boost drink, which is this gluey sweet soy based protien drink that I happen to like.  I hoped that it would mask the smell and taste of the powder well.  It didn't.  Drinking the potion was PURE hell and it is not something that I want to repeat.<BR>

I began to feel the effects on my toungue within seconds.  The numbing effect was intense and lasted about 30 minutes after my last sip.   I worked on the potion, about 10 oz, for about 30 minutes, giving a few sips to my friends, who told me I was retarded and that there was no point to doing something that nasty.  Little did they know...<BR>
<BR>
After the numbing disappeared I noticed that my limbs felt very disconnected and strange, and moving became a chore.  All I wanted to do was to sit down and lean back.  I could barely stay awake.  The effect was intensly soporific.  I didn't want to pass out so I started listening to music and telling my friends to keep me awake.  I felt very loving to them and I started leaning on my friends back and concentrating on the music.  I tried to sing along but the words didn't come out very clearly.  After about an hour I started to feel less tired and heavy and more buzzed.  I felt very happy for somebody whose mouth tasted like dirt.  The taste of the Kava Kava powder was very heavy and stayed with for a couple of days.<BR>

Anyways, I had to go home with mom and pop at about 1 o clock and I was very tired and relaxed.   All I wanted to do was get into bed.  In the morning I felt slightly sick but the feeling passed after I ate breakfast.
