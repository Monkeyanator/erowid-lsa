This being my first experience with Kava I was a bit nervous at first. I read some good experiences on this website and decided to try it. I went to my local pharmacy and bought the first Kava capsules I found. <BR>
<BR>
I figured it would take about 750 mg of Kavalactones to have an effect on me. Me being a stupid-ass I calculated the amount of Kavalactones to be about 600 mg in the Kava capsules I had. So I took them all at the same time and went about my day. A few hours later I started feeling funny somehow. Sound started to sound boxed or something. I feelt like I was really drunk. Then, EUPHORIA. It was like I had gotten a shot of morphine. After no more than 5 minutes of this I became very sleepy and for some reason layed down on my couch. I fell asleap instantly even though it was the middle of the day.<BR>

I woke up 5 hours later feeling absolutely lethargic. It turned out I had taken 3600 mg of Kavalactones. So the moral of this story is: calculate your Kava carefully and respect this herb.
