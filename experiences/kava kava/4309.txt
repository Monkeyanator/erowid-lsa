<!--smoked kava--><BR>

After taking kava in an emulsiuon, capsule, and tea forms, I started to tire of the excessive ammounts of kava needed to achieve any sort of psychicly altered state. Thats when i decided to try smoking a little bit of it given the generally more pronounced (yet shorter lasting) trips that are generally experianced when smoking a substance.<BR>

I started by break one capsule open and rolling the powder inside into a little packet using some rolling paper. The capsule contained kava extract mixed with a little kava plant material. I then placed this little packet into my pipe and lit it up. The smoke was very sharp tasting at first and smelled very strongly of kava, but as I held the hit in, it quick lost all sharpness and felt very gentle. I took at most 5 hits in this manner and did not smoke the entire capsule.<BR>

The effects were pronounced, especially for the small ammount I consumed. I felt very much at ease and was too relaxed to move very much for the duration of the experiance. I would rate the intensity of this method on the order of a few alcoholic drinks or a single small hit of canibis. Although I did not achive the highly altered state i was looking for, I did enjoy enjoy the feeling. The entire effects of the kava were gone after an hour and were pretty consistant throughout.<BR>

Since this initial test, I have smoked kava extract twice more. It is probibly the most economical method of its consumption, needing less than a typical over the counter dose to get effects, but given the relative inexpensive nature of kava and the hazards of smoking, it is not a practice I will do often. I can definately forsee smoking it in conjunction with canibis, however, and I await what I might experiance as a result.
