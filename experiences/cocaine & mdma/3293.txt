<!--Combination of MDMA and Cocaine--><BR>
<BR>
This experience is about the combined use of very pure cocaine and very pure MDMA. <BR>
<BR>
It goes as follow. After a delightful holiday in the south of France, surfing away for about two weeks, me and two friends of mine drove back home in my car, an old and cosy Renault 19 (for the sake of the story :). We had taken about twenty MDMA pills with us when we left, and some ten were left. The night before, we had been doing the MDMA, and I hadn't slept much, an hour or so - nonetheless, I felt great.<BR>
<BR>
After some 500 km, one of my friends suggested that we take some of the MDMA, since we'd have to smuggle it all over the border again otherwise. I agreed, but only when we would take small quantities - a quarter of a pill. So it went.<BR>
<BR>
And we drove on, and on, and took more quarters, and more quarters. Soon we started tripping slightly - one of those wonderfully colorful MDMA trips. The whole ride back home was one big adventure, full of wonderfully profound conversations about our friendship, about how great the holiday had been, about what would happen next (we were all three leaving abroad for quite some time). In the end, we were all naked in the car, because we felt more comfortable that way.<BR>
<BR>
When halfway, I decided we needed some cocaine to spice up our night. The two friends I was with either never tried cocaine, or only once or twice. So I called up my dealer, ordered some four g's. We picked up the coke on our way home. And that's where the experience started.<BR>
<BR>
We were all heavily influenced by the E, and started sniffing good quantities of very pure cocaine.  The combination was wonderful: it took away our fatigue, intensified our bond. But it also almost entirely covered up the effect of the MDMA, while the coke lasted its full effect. When the coke started wearing down, after some thirty minutes each time, the MDMA would come back up, roaring, making us trip all over. Another line of coke would cover up the MDMA again, and then disappear, and so on till all of the cocaine was gone.<BR>
<BR>
When I look back at it now, I must say it was a great experience. But not one I would repeat, unless I have - as I did at that time - enough coke to spare. For the cocaine wears you down, while the MDMA wears off slowly. And then, in the end, you need the cocaine to keep you going, to make the fatigue go away.<BR>
<BR>
To all of you who intend trying this one time: take the E, but wait with the cocaine till the E wears off. That way, you got the best of the best, twice.
