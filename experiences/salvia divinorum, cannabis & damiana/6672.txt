I've tried Salvia many times. I've already tried salvia's leaves, 5x and 10x extract. The effect was weird, sometimes strong, more physical than mental. It's wasn't a very pleasant exp.<BR>

Then, i've tried some salvia's leaves mixed with weed and also a little Damania, smoked in big joints (about 7 joints!) The mix Cannabis/salvia is very good, the effect made me feel meditative.It remind me of psilocybin effect.<BR>

So, now i'll always use salvia blend with weed.
