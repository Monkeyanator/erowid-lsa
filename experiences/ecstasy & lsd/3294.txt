This day I had not planned anything but to trip. I was waiting for the sunset because I love tripping at night. My cousin, my brother and I were going to get into it and have lots of fun.  At about 7pm we ate a purple geltab of acid each. While we waited my brother's roomate and like 3 of his friends showed up.  They had pot and went on to smoke it, but I was not getting into that because I wanted to feel my trip completely, not be high and imagine somethin that was not happening.  So after an hour of wait I start feeling the effects and felt in another zone. The trip took me to a state I had NEVER been before, I felt so good I had total control over my trip that I could not stop talking about it. <BR>

Later on I found out that the friends of my bro's roomate had rolls, doublestack fishbone they called them. I bought one and so did my brother... Oh man, the best decision I have ever made. I took the bean and tripped while I waited to roll. We (my bro, my cousin and I) started to dance with a some DJ Dara pumpin. I have a set of 'lightrix' glasses which make any light source sparkle. While wearing those my cousin told me he was gonna blow me up and oh he did. He played around with the glowstix and made me go into a 'tunnel'... I swear I saw zebra stripes on the walls and I fell back on my brothers bed, I thought I was gonna pass out and got scared, so I got up and continued to trip. The roll had just kicked in, I was seeing trippy stuff everywhere and my body felt like water.  As soon as we stepped outside the other people there saw us rollin nuts and trippin stars and go hyped up to do it with us. How exiting that felt!! More people wanted to be in 'our world' but we were in another dimension by then and they did not hav acid so they were never gonna feel like us.  We went to the roof of the apartment and laid on the floor to check out the clouds. They were bright pink and the rest of the sky was purple. As I peered deeper and deeper into space I could see swirls of amazing colors and little flying objects. I knew I was definetly trippin balls.  When we went downstairs the other ppl rollin were doing weird tricks (carrying each other, stretching out..) I joined because I wanted to feel the roll again, I had been like 30 minutes on the roof and was not fully enjoying my bean. So I was carried 'airplane' style and put to the ground. It was awesome, but nothing new. So I go out to the balcony afterwards and this guy who was on speed was talking shit, but I did not care as long as he kept feedin me his Lucky Strikes.  I was lookin at the sky, totally ignoring the fucker. The clouds again captivated me. They were moving faster and faster. I was dazed. My 'trip-roll' went on for hours. But when I came down from the roll the acid still had me. I laid out on the couch and so did my bro and my cousin. We stayed there for some time, gazing at whatever we wanted to. I cant quite remember what we did cause I was probably thinking so hard. We stayed up till like 7am. It rained and the rain looked like a river flowing thru the asphalt on the street.<BR>
<BR>
It was over by then. I passed out on the couch.<BR>
<BR>
The next day, after I woke up I felt eaten up because of all the fun from the night before. I can say it was the first time I trolled and I recomend it to anyone who has experience in the field.<BR>
PEACE
