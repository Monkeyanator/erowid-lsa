On this particular weekend, my friend and I were fortunate enough to come across a large amount of mushrooms, 1 1/4 ounce to be exact. The frist night we each ate an 8th. This was just like any other shroom trip we've ever had. The second night, however, was anything but ordinary. We decided to step out on a limb and eat ALL the rest of the bag. This was half an ounce of shrooms EACH.<BR>

We ate them, which was no small task in and of itself. Once they were down, we went swimming and went in the spa. We started to feel rather floaty after about 20 minutes, so we went inside and layed in our respective sleeping areas. I was staring at the Blue Man Group poster on my ceiling, when suddelny the Blue Man in the front of the group turned into my dad and started smiling at me. This was quite freaky, so my friend and I turned on the lights and were talking to people on the internet.<BR>

We then decided to call one of our good friends and talk to her for a while. We ended up talking to her for the entire night (about 7 hours). During that time, the walls were melting, the carpet was growing and then shrinking, and everything was funny as hell. Twice I got up to go to the bathroom, and ended up staying in there for a half an hour both times. The towels were growing and shrinking, and the stripes on a tiger striped bathing suit were bleeding out and sucking back in.<BR>

The most amazing thing about that was the wall in front of me. It looked like a magic eye poster but it had an entire city in it, complete with talking people, lava rivers, and long necked monsters that moved boulders around. The rest of the night was spent rolling around on my bed and my friend spinning around on a chair for 5 hours. The enitre time we were talking to our friend on the phone and she was thing that made it so fun, or so we think. At one time I found myself making out with my arm and rolling around with pillows.<BR>

It was the most fun I have ever had, and I would do it again if it wasn't so hard to get down.
