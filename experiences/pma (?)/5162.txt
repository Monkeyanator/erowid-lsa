We were just having dinner. As we know that it's better to eat before a roll than during or after. The dinner was chicken and vegetables. no alcohol was used during the meal. A half hour of talking time passed and we dropped. Three of us. We all had taken MDMA before and even took 'Mistubishi's' while in England. I hadn't heard of the PMA rumors prior to the ight so there was no worry. In preparation we consumed quite a bit of water as usual. An hour later at approx. 11PM the roll started. All seemed normal, like MDMA. Then about another half an hour later, I became more disoriented than prior rolls. Dizziness followed by a sharp pain in my head. My speach was slering and it was hard to stand on my own. Then the stomach ache hit very fast and hard. Drinking water was constant but usules as, I didn't feel dehydrated. Friends were aware of my symptoms and aided me to a bed. At which time a friend placed their hand on my forehead, the heat was unbearable.<BR>

Cold cloths were placed on my head, base on neck and wrists. then the vomiting stared, there went dinner. more water in and more dinner out. after about a half hour of vomiting I was ready to sleep, which was hard. Three hours later I awoke for the most part relieved. The 'Worm' in my brain was gone and The vomiting was done. the time~3AM I went down stairs to see friends and they appeared to be fine. they took the same thing I had and were showing none of the symptoms that I had. I believe that because they normally rolled on three pills that they had built up a tolerance for the drug. more so than I. I drank more water and went home to get more sleep. Afterwards I promised myself to attain as much information of the drugs that  I take before I take them. This similar scenario happened to two other friends other than those I was with days later.   Thank You  & safe rolling
