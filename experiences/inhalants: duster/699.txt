<span class='erowid-warning'>[Erowid Note: 
Our understanding of the literature is that there is no such thing as safe recreational use of volatile solvents, aerosols and other street inhalants : their psychoactive effects are inseparable from nerve and organ damage. We have chosen to include these reports to help document the real world use of inhalants, but their inclusion is not intended to imply that they are anything but dangerous.]</span> <br/>

After noticing the absence of any duster reports on the 'inhalants' area of erowid, I decided on posting this account. First of all, to all those who dont know what dusters are, they are, well, computer dusters. You can get them at your local electronics store, or 'mart'(dont want to say company names). They come in non-aerosol sprays, wipes, and aerosol cans. Make sure you get the aerosol cans, or else this wont work. <br/>
<br/>
How to operate the duster:  after opening, simply inhale the air from the can. MAKE SURE THE CAN IS UPRIGHT, or else you will freeze your lungs and spend some time in the hospital. Safety first.<br/>
<br/>
They cause a feeling most like 'whippets'(nitrous). Vibrating, disconnected feeling, audio hallucinations that last for a short time.<br/>
<br/>
Now, on with the story. My most recent account with dusters was the most unusual to date. Usually, we just cruise around and inhale. Almost always it is accompanied by the use of the canabis plant. Anyways, this time we had planned on some party games while under the influence of the canabis and the duster. It was pretty late, about 3am, and a perfect time for 'duster races'. We would line up 2 at a time, take a lung-full of the duster, and try to race each other. Of course, the races werent that competitive, but at least they were fun. The experience gave the feeling of floating along at a very fast speed. Overall, it was fun.
