Ack what a nightmare.<BR>
<BR>
1 gram Clenbuterol was obtained, later it was measured and dissolved into water to make the proper amount ratio per ml.<BR>
<BR>
But looky here:<BR>
<BR>
Some clenbuterol, what seemed to be very little stayed on the tool which was used to move the clenbuterol from one container to another.<BR>
<BR>
Hey there (I thought in stuper), why dont I taste the remain and see what happens. (Can you think of something more ingeniues?--looking back, it was one of my most stupid and dangerous decisions of my life)<BR>
<BR>
Apparently an amount of approximately 5 - 8 miligram of clenbuterol was sublingually ingested, possibly more. (normal dose is at the microgram area), for those who dont know Clenbuterol is active at even 100 mcg.<BR>
<BR>
with the ~5000-8000 mcg that was ingested, some 50-80 times stronger the active dose, some unwanted effects might occur if you plan to live a healthy life, dont mistake where I have.<BR>
<BR>
T+30: Strange feeling, as if consciousness had changed, but not similiar to anything I ever felt.<BR>
<BR>
T+1h: Feeling somewhat better than normal (if only I would know what was ahead of me....) Is this clenbuterol i thought?<BR>
<BR>
T+2h: Heart rate is higher, but not alarming.<BR>
<BR>
T+3h: Eyes are open wide, and face is feeling stretched, something is building up, and fast.<BR>
<BR>
T+4h: Eyeballs seem to receive some greenish color besides the normal white... and quite amount of axienty had built up, dizzyness and nausea, but somewhat consciousness enhancement, certainly not a good time.<BR>
<BR>
T+5h: feeling quite ill, heart begins to speed up, and for the next 24 hours the heart rate stays at a steady alarming 125-135 beats per minute (WHILE LYING DOWN WITH HEAD ON PILLOW), i could hear my heart with my ear as the vains in my head and the entire body are all swallen up and beating, I can feel the blood pumping intensively, and I feel as I am ready to explode.  My girlfriend urges me to get an ambulance, but I disagree, hoping its going to be fine and reassuring her i'm 'okayyyy.'<BR>
<BR>
My entire body was dancing to the beats of my heart; and it was the worst tune you could ever imagine.<BR>
<BR>
T+6h: From here on after for the next 18 hours, intense pressure in my head and limbs had built up, eyes got more wide open, and skin more stretched.<BR>
<BR>
T+12h: It feels as if my heart cant take it anymore as i feel it loosens in some fraile way, and begins to irregularly beat, which is extremely uncomfortable, and quite dangerous.<BR>
<BR>
T+13h: I get dehydrated rather easily, and my tempeature is 38 degrees celceus.<BR>
<BR>
T+15h: for the past hour the tempeature has risen +1 degree.  I am now considering the ambulance theory (in my head), as I feel I cant take much more of this.<BR>
<BR>
T+16h: The pressure in the head is unbearable and keeps on increasing, the pain arises as if the skull pressures the brain and there is a psychological feeling as if brain fluid is frying the brain, from the temperature :)<BR>
<BR>
T+17h: A cold shower really helped ... ALOT.<BR>
<BR>
T+19h: Another shower helped.<BR>
<BR>
T+20h: I'm quite tired and exhusted, but in agonizing head pain fearing taking any sedatives since i dont know what interacts with this and how; i take 750mg Paracetamol.<BR>
<BR>
T+21h: Feeling a bit better, but still -- headache is anguishing, I am utterly exhusted and afraid to fall asleep, although possibly, i can.<BR>
<BR>
T+24h: Heart rate down to 120 per minute, and tempeature had decreased by two degrees the past two hours, a nice opportunity to get some sleep<BR>
<BR>
T+32h: Woke up.... (Thank God, I'm alive!) heart rate is still at a steady 120 beats per minute while lying down #!$#!$#!$!%<BR>
<BR>
T+42h: heart rate down to a steady 105 beats per minute<BR>
<BR>
t+70h: 65 beats per minute, lying down.<BR>
<BR>
For the following week, intense vain, skin, and eye pain was felt, besides the utter exhustion and the sharp pain in the center of the head. <BR>
<BR>
Thank God, For He saved me from my stupidity :) That only my faith kept me going, thougout this living nightmare.<BR>
<BR>
There were many side effects during the experience, of pseudohallucenogenic nature: closed and open eye visual effects, very hard stimulation; food was tasteless and meaningless, and would result in vomiting; nothing could be drank besides water, or heartburn would occur, and it did, from drinking Cola, alone.  Increased sweating, and increased resperation, hard amphetamiine-like jitterness which lasted throughout the entire horryfing experience, highly-extremely increased metabolic rate,<BR>
tempeature changes, general change in consciousness, ear popping, and some more things.<BR>
<BR>
Overall, This was my first experience with this pseudosteroidical<BR>
substance, which i didnt take seriously, and i paid the price, and i'm lucky i'm alive to report it.<BR>
<BR>
Dont be stupid.  If you cant measure something properly, and or not sure of its potency - DO NOT DO IT: as tempting or curiousing as it may be, you might not be as lucky as I was.<BR>
<BR>
What a nightmare<BR>
Thank God its over.
