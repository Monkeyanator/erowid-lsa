I bought 4 packs of Heavenly Blue Morning Glories from K-mart and then went home to prepare them.  At first I tried to grind them in a pepper grinder, but only half of the seeds had been ground.  I put the remaining seeds and powder into 2 coffee filters, and then put another on top of them, folded the sides up and tied it off with a twist-tie and let it sit in a bowl of water (with a lid) for 5-6 hours.<BR>
<BR>
After all that was over, I spread the paste-seed stuff out and let it dry while I slept.  The next day, after I got home I powdered it with Ginger (which was a bad idea, but I heard that it helped stop nausea.)  To stop nausea, I took 1 Meclizine, which is an over the counter pill that is anti-dizziness.  Then I ate 3grams out of the 6 that I had, and after washing the NASTY ginger taste down, I took a sip of Emotrol (anti-nausea liquid) to stop nausea all together.  Then I went out with my friends.<BR>
<BR>
We went to this place where they like to skate, but there's also a stream that runs for a long way back into some woods.  We walked around there for a while and I didn't really feel anything, or notice anything.  Eventually I can home, sat down, and looked at my computer screen.  Suddenly I noticed these 2 white spheres of energy in front of me, and they would move closer and farther as I tilted my head.<BR>
<BR>
After that I started to feel VERY heavy, and very unmotivated.  When I finally did get up, I went to the bathroom, and while I was sitting there I looked at the towel hanging in front of me and it started to bubble and boil almost, but it was a slow bubble.  I sat with my mouth open for a while and smiled really big.<BR>
<BR>
Then I ate a chicken dinner, and for some reason the chicken tasted like no other chicken I had eaten before.  It was great.<BR>
<BR>
That was my first trip.<BR>
<BR>
My second trip (2 days later) consisted of the same preparation, and the same anti-nausea precautions.  I'm pretty sure I had a little more than 3 grams this time, 'cause the trip was twice as good.  It started out with me and a friend taking ours, and then sitting around for a while.  We did this at 6:30, and I started to get warm feelings in certain areas.  My ears were getting hot, and my face was warm.  After a while, I decided to go trip on my trampoline.  I got on my back and just waited...  I watched the trees, and I could pick faces out in the leaves.  I began staring at certain spots and watching everything around that spot turn into a starry sky, while the spot stayed the same.<BR>
<BR>
Eventually I looked down and noticed a white-outline (like when the guy from 'Hollow Man' was barely visible) guy stradling me, and my stomach was open like cabinet doors.  He had his hands down inside the cavity and was searching around, and then he lifted up a handfull of gold treasure.  I was amazed as he showed it to me.  Then I looked to my left, and saw a woman lying there looking at me.  I looked to my right, and another woman was there doing the same.  I looked back up into the trees and could see the white-outline faces of them, talking to me, but I couldn't hear them.  And then the trees seemed to be haunting me somehow.  They were all out to get me, and I thought they might pick me up and try to hurt me, so I curled up and closed my eyes for a while.<BR>
<BR>
I got up and decided that the trees couldn't hurt me.  And then I noticed my shadow on the house, and thought, 'Oh my god!  Someone's watching me!'  I figured out it was me after I moved a bit, and then I started to jump.  It felt very slow, like I was slightly in control of gravity whenever I'd do a flip.  I saw a car pull up and decided to go inside 'cause it was probably my friend.<BR>
<BR>
After going inside I saw that he had messaged me a few times and told me to page him if I wanted to do anything.  So I paged him and he picked me up and said, 'Dude, where were you?  I went into your house and no one was there...'  And I explained that I was on the trampoline, and then asked when he had tried to come get me.  He said 8:30, but when I got inside it was about 9:05...  I said, 'Wow...  I saw a car pull up and decided to go inside, but I guess somewhere in there I lost a half an hour.'<BR>
<BR>
He started asking me what it was like to trip, and I told him.  We went to yet another skating spot where everyone was skating, and I met some other friends.  A couple of them were stoned, and we shared some stories, including the one where the guy had pulled gold out of me.<BR>
<BR>
Then everyone left and me and my friend went to a coffee shop to play chess (we do this a lot.)  Concentrating on the game was difficult, and he beat me twice before I finally outwitted him.  Then we played once more, and I went home.  My trip was fading, and I could tell.<BR>
<BR>
Both trips were pretty fun, but the second was definatly more exciting and mind expanding than the first.
