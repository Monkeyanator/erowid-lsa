I'll keep this brief.  Today at 11:00am I at consumed 7.5g of seeds, they where well washed and certified to have no fertilizer added.  Before ingestion I ate a light meal of 2 waffles.<BR>
<BR>
Within an hour felt as if I was drunk but without any euphoria.  Within ten more minutes I started feeling horribly horribly sick and vomited on and off until 6:00pm.  These seeds were truly not worth it.  There were _very_ mild visual effects..but was only at the peak for about an hour (from roughly 3:00pm - 4:00ish).<BR>
<BR>
The only reason I'm writing this is to warm others.  It might be worth it if the LSA is extracted but I'll NEVER ingest the seed matter again.  I've never felt so sick in my life.   Once I drank (alcohol) till I convulsed and threw up blood..and the sickness and hangover from that was a little less horrid then what just 7.5g of these horrible little seeds did to me.<BR>
<BR>
Please forgive the gramatic errors in this account.  But I hope it makes other think twice before eating these seeds in their raw state...I have heard that the extracted LSA is great...but I'll never try, the thought of these seeds makes me want to vomit.
