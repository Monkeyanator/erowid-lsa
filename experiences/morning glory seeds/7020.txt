I am a young adult greatly interested in various drugs but inexperienced. I have always wanted to hallucinate but have yet to find great access to LSD or Shrooms. My Strange friend related me to his random yet frequent experiences with morning glory seeds.<BR>
<BR>
He gave me his insight and his method of using the precious LSA that is inside them. So I went to the local garden center and purchased 200 heavenly Blue 50 flying saucers and 50 pearly gates.<BR>

On Sunday between 6-7 pm I concentrated all of my energy beating the seeds into a pulp with a meat-beater type thing. After most of the seeds were mushed apart and destroyed I put the 'goo' mixture into a glass and filled it with plain water. According to my friend all I had to do was let the water sit for 2-3 hours and drink the liquid. I could leave the seeds be if I wanted. So at 9 that night I drank the liquid and a little bit of the pulp. It tasted like like plain water and was not as bad as I thought. It began working quickly but this particular method had some unpleasant effects. I became incredibly sick to my stomach and could not enjoy any minimal hallucinations I was having. I tried to enjoy what was happening but spent most of the time clenching my chest in pain. I finally gave up and went to sleep. At midnight I woke up and found my stomach ache was gone. Wandering out of my bedroom I examined the unusual shadows and strangly different look of the long hallways in my house. I sat in the living room listening to music in the dark, the music sounded the same and I became bored quickly.<BR>

The Sky was extrodinarily beautiful though being the only thing in my sight of color. The next morning when I arrived at school everyone said my eyes looked crazy, with gigantic pupils, as if I was on some form of drug. Later I was told that my pupils became really small. I wish this had not been my first experience with psychedelics of any kind, in the future I am simply going to buy some acid.
