This is brief.  I bought 2 packages of Burpee brand Heavenly Blues seeds from Walmart and must confess, this is a good buzz.  A very good buzz.  I only took 2 packages, which is around 150 seeds.  This produces a very smooth, mellow, slightly trippy reaction.  All of the negative experiences I have read on this board come from people who took way too many  (3000?  come on!) or mixed their seeds with other drugs.  Stupid.<BR>

Yes, there is a little nausea at first.  But nothing to flip out over.  But I didn't chew up 3,000 seeds either, so I can't vouch for those folks.<BR>

Overrall, like really righteous cannabis accompanied by very mild auditory/visual hallucinations.  But only take 100 to 150 max for the first time.  You will get a very nice buzz.<BR>

And to everyone bitching about the cost, stating acid is still 2 bucks a hit while the seeds are around .94 cents a pack.  Might I remind everyone, acid is illegal.  This is not.
