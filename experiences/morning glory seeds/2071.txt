I just thought I would relate a brief personal experience with Morning Glory. This is not my first negative experience, but this was by far the worst.<BR>
<BR>
10:00pm Washed off store bought seeds (in a vain attempt to remove any fungicide). Started to grind them<BR>
<BR>
10:45pm With a very, very tired arm, I was done grinding them. I put them in water and let them soak, stirring occasionally. Took 1 dramamine.<BR>
<BR>
11:30pm Poured the liquid through a coffee filter, then drank it. It didn't taste or smell badly.<BR>
<BR>
12:30pm Felt a little buzz, and a little sick.<BR>
<BR>
1:30pm Visited my friend, the toilet. Felt slightly better, went back to my room.<BR>
<BR>
1:45pm Dropped by to visit the toilet again.<BR>
<BR>
4:00pm Still at the somewhat strange looking toilet, drinking water so I could have something to puke. Dry heaving had grown old...<BR>
<BR>
5:00pm Fell asleep, hoping I would not choke on my own vomit.<BR>
<BR>
It's been about a week, and my digestive system has still not fully recovered.<BR>
<BR>
Just thought I'd give an experience to those thinking to try it.... :)
