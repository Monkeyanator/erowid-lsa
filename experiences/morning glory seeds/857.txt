Being a connoisseur of hallucinogens, I of course, like most of my spirit seeking colleagues, had to try morning glory seeds.  I found a company on the net which sold the seeds at very low prices, I had also been able to order San Pedro cactus.  That is for a later story.  I had already tried the seeds a few times before and my long-time friend was willing, so he came down and I ground up about a cup of seeds and put them into empty gelcapsules.  What we do to get high....<BR>

Anyway, I gulped them down quickly, while my friend ate them one by one washing them down with beer.  Bad idea. My friend finally finished his and we decided, since the nausea had already started, to go and eat.  We got some Italian beefs, wrong again.  About 5-minutes after finishing, my friend got sick and threw up.  Not a problem, considering I had this already figured out, we went under a tree and laid down for awhile.<BR>

About 30 minutes after ingestion, the trip began.  It started out pleasant enough (except for the nausea).  The clouds started dancing and turning pale violet and blue.  We were having fun, but decided to go inside because it was getting cold.  Again, bad idea.  As soon as we started to walk, my friend started getting sick again.  By the time we got to the room, we both looked like lunatics and my friend promptly threw up in my garbage.  A few minutes passed and he threw up again.  This kept going for a couple of hours; he had the biggest stomach I had ever seen.  At one point he couldn't breath and started to scare the shit out of me.  I wasn't sure that these were completely safe, considering the ergot-like effects of artery and vein constriction.  One tends to get oxygen deprivation cramps in his neck and legs.  Not something I think is too healthy, especially for those with a bad heart.  We decided to watch Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and sluggishly crept through the remainder of the trip.  I hadn't thrown up, but John had done enough for both of us.  I have found in retrospect that while I was lying down the queasiness was bearable and made the trip a lot more relaxing and enjoyable.  Since most of the seeds seem to be thrown up I would expect that as few as 10 caps would suffice, as long as one could keep them down.  They leave a nasty aftertaste and following that last experience I threw the rest out.<BR>

I read somewhere that the vine will punish those who disrespect it and treat it like a drug. I feel that is true.  Outside the energy was calm and protective, but the inside environment was claustrophobic, and we had also picked up on my roommate's negativity towards our use.  Definitely be ready for a rough time if you are feeling bad--it will only get worse.  This is not something to use for fun, only to learn.  Most people couldn't handle this trip, different and stronger than LSD.  I'm surprised that it is even legal, someone could really hurt themselves.  Be careful, and understand the spirit doesn't allow for weak-minded and misdirected intentions.  Trip well....
