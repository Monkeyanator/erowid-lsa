Well I've been growing morning glories for years, and have decided to take the plunge.  I read in the Anrachist's Cookbook, that 50 grams of seeds is equal to one trip (for LSA extraction).  So this year's harvist of heavenly blue was about 500 grams or so...so I decided to snag a couple of the vine, and weigh them.  I weighed out 55 grams which was about 2 handful's or so.  These were fresh off the vine, soft, and tasted like bitter lettuce or something.  It took about 1 hour for me to eat them all, and after about 40 minutes I started to feel funny, so I left to a friend's house, were maybe I could be entertained.<BR>

I couldn't stay there so I went with another friend to the park, it was nice while I layed in the grass with a very nice trip.  Well soon night fell, and I started to feel really strange, I got up to walk around and felt dizzy...as I was walking I started to feel like I would vomit, ad all the sudden in front of all these strangers, I started dry heaving...yuck.  More followed in the next few minutes while I kept walking...no actual vomitting though.  I started to feel like I would die, and told my friend to take me to the hospital if I passed out...time passed and I was really out of it.  It was almost like being drunk, but wicked trailing effects, and extreme paranoia.<BR>

I later saw some friends who were also tripping from LSD, so it made me feel so much better...we talked and played hacky sack for a while, then it was time to go: it was late.  So my friend and I drove around for a while, oh now I had to piss, we stopped in the middle of an open parking lot and I pissed right in the open, but it was the strangest feeling, I felt like my entire body was having an organsm!  Wow...we went to my friends house where I talked to her for 15 minutes(what felt like 45) about my childhood...I'm sure I was rambling, but I felt like I made sense...Well as I tried to fall asleep their saw strange things in my head, skulls biting me, etc...Eventually I got to sleep.<BR>

The next day was horrible I felt like crap so I took some Kava Kava to brighten the day.  Well I did a little research into why my trip was so heavy...I had taken 5 to 10 times the regular dose, and sinse it was fresh wet, it was more powerful since the LSA's had little or no time to decompose!  So in short it was powerful up and down, good and bad.  From now on I'll make sure to stuff like this before you trying anything new, and read dosages from multiple sources...
