I had read about morning glories off and on during 1999-2000 and found that Wal-Mart was selling them.  I was suprised to find that there were many packs of seeds there, on average there were about 15 or so packets of each seed (the equivalent of one row of seeds).  Yet for the pretty little Heavenly Blue Morning Glories there were 9 rows of packets.  This had me thinking that there must be some reason for having so many.  Must be a big seller.  Anyway, I digress.  A friend and I decided to buy 9 packs, since I determined there were about 50 seeds in each pack.<BR>

Later that day, we decided to take the little beauties.  Our method of consumption was to take 150 seeds and place them between two paper plates, where we used a hammer to bang them all up.  It was hard and I'm sure a coffee grinder would work better, but, hey, we had to make due with what we had.  After crushing them up we ate all of those nasty-ass tasting seeds.  The taste was horrible.  I had heard of stomach discomfort, so we prepared for it.  After about 1 hour our stomachs ached, but it was bearable.  I didn't want to give up my goodies before I had the chance to get the effects.  Shortly after I could feel the oncoming of the seeds.  We were sitting watching TV and all I could think of was getting the lady on the TV and laying her down for a little of the old 'in-out-in-out.'<BR>

I won't really waste anymore time on the trip although to say that I didn't get ANY visuals, I considered it more of a shroom trip without the visuals.  And that I LOVED going outside and just doing goofy shit that I would probably never do sober, drunk, or high.  It was nice.  A little muscle discomfort, but all good.  We didn't want to smoke any pot with the trip just to see what the seeds would do, alone.<BR>

Ready for another try, we purchased a few more seeds and did the same thing the next day.  Ate the seemingly unpalatable seeds, only this time we tried 180 seeds.  The same stomach discomfort came about, but it was all cool.  There was a problem though.  This time my muscles felt like they were going to snap if I moved too much.  It was a very nasty feeling.  I'm guessing that there was some contaminant on the seed and it was making me feel pretty bad.  When this happened I was so pissed that we decided to get a little green in our diet.  We smoked two bowls of weed and after that everything was AWESOME.  It was the best part of the trip.  I was pretty pissed that I hadn't thought about it sooner.  All I remember now is being extremely cold and walking around with a bed cover over me.  That and watching a baseball game and laughing my ass off.  Unfortunately my muscles ached for about 4 days after.<BR>
<BR>
I found the seeds to be very enjoyable, but I might have been able to take away the muscle pain if I had washed the seeds before hand.  In conclusion:<BR>
<BR>
morning glories = good<BR>
morning glories + pot = awesome
