It was a Thursday night at college in Boston, a night not unlike many before. Actually, one thing was different.<BR>
 <BR>
The night before I had obtained some hits of liquid acid in sugarcube form. I got out of work at 8:30pm and dropped all three immediately as I walked home to my building. <BR>
<BR>
I began to feel a mild sensation of dizziness which is usually my clue that I am about to feel the acid effects about 45 minutes later as I was showering. I dressed and got ready to go out to my friend's birthday party as the drug began to manifest itself.<BR>
<BR>
T + 1.5 hours: At the party I had been playing some beer games and talking to friends. A local drug dealer noticed that my pupils were dilated and asked me where I got the pills (meaning ecstasy). I told him I was tripping on acid (since I knew him and was not afraid he'd be weird about it). He offered me a pill if I'd get him some acid the next weekend, so I agreed. I took the pill immediately and chewed it completely up in my mouth to hasten the effects. <BR>
<BR>
T + 2.5 hours: The MDMA has been steadily climbing, colorful blobs began to pulse rhythymically in my field of vision, growing in intensity as the peak approached. I began peaking on the MDMA and acid very closely together. After drinking three or four more beers I decide I no longer want to drink anymore. <BR>
<BR>
T + 4 hours: At around 12:30 I leave the party with another drug dealer I know and return to her building to buy some really good buds she had. I got 1/8 and rolled up two joints for the walk back to the party. I walked through the Boston Common smoking joints and being completely awed by the grass and trees growing in the middle of the urban setting. My mind pictures a flower growing out of a crack in the sidewalk. At this point I began to watch my 'mind's eye' images (eidetic imagery, as explained in 'The Varieties of Psychedelic Experience' which is an extraordinary book, btw). I made it back to the party only to find my roommate has gotten into a big fight and had to be taken away to our friend's place in another neighborhood. I smoked another joint with the girl whose birthday it was, then headed out to find my roommate. Right before I was about to leave the drug dealer I got the E from pulled me aside and asked if I wanted to split a pill for free. I accepted and he crushed the pill and made two lines. I usually don't like to snort, but I decided to go for it anyways. After blowing the line of ecstasy I set off. <BR>
<BR>
T + 5 hours: I arrived at the apartment after taking WAY longer than normal to find it. I told my friends I feel 'a little funny' then sat down and smoked almost all the rest of the marijuana with them. They rolled up a big blunt with their own weed and we decided to go for a walk down to the bridge over the Charles River where we sparked the blunt and watch the river and traffic, plus the skyline of Cambridge. At this point I am tripping very hard... my friends melt and reform, carlights bend out in all directions, the sky changes colors and clouds fly by as if they were in stop motion videos...<BR>
<BR>
T + 8 hours: After coming home I closed my eyes and lay in bed. I found myself immersed in some kind of interior mental image of myself and my girlfriend making love. This image shifted away to a wide variety of different scenes populated by figures both familiar to me and some that were not. At some point my consciousness slipped away and I fell asleep.<BR>
<BR>
As a postscript to this report I'd like to say that I didn't feel I was as messed up as I ought to have been at the time. I had taken a lot of drugs and was expecting a more total immersion into some sort of fantasy world. I was functional and able to speak somewhat rationally throughout the duration of my trip. I found the following three nights that when I drank and smoked I felt the trip coming back to a certain extent, and saw some motion trails and strange visualizations. The fourth night this effect was very diminshed (perhaps due to my sobriety) and since I have not had any other side effects from the trip. <BR>
<BR>
I would highly recommend the candyflip, however leave the alcohol out of it. There is no reason to drink when you are on that many drugs, it doesn't even seem to make a difference at all.
