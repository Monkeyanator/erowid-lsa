Well, ive been a pretty big pothead the last couple years and havent really touched much else save alcohol and the ocasional exotic high, so i decided that it was time to Just Say N2O. I went to the store picked up the can of cheap whipped cream and ice cream for afterwards. I spent a considerable amount of time lurking around the erowid nitrous vault making sure i wasnt gonna flip shit when i did it. I got a pretty low dose so i was safe. The next thing was to crank some 'Are You Experienced?', by Hendrix and get to business. Did the hyperventalation before hitting the can to help matters. It only took a few seconds to kick in and a few seconds to last but in the space of those few seconds the only words that seem to describe the situation is 'fuzzy bubble'. Vision seemed to change first and peak with a pleasant headbuzz. Very fun just wish it lasted longer, hmm maybe thats why people go through em so fast ... peace
