Last weekend i was at a shop that sold heaps of legal highs and stuff, I was looking for something different to try because me and my mate were stopping weed for a little while. anyways i was in the shop and saw nitrous and decided to give it a go so i bought a box of nitrous cannisters that are called 'whipped cream cannisters'.<BR>

When i got to my mates house i told him i had some nitrous and we straight away went and tried them. so i got the first little cannister, put it in the inhaler, twisted it round till it punchered that little bitch and inhaled the whole thing back in one and held it in for about 30 seconds...and nothing happend so i did the same with the next one and the one after that.  Finally i got a slight head rush, which must have been due to lack of oxygen, but i thought something was happening so i quickly had the rest till my share was finnished. What a waste of time...10 little whipped cream cannisters and all i got was a head rush.  my mate then had his 10 and the same thing happend....nothing...<BR>

i thought it might take a while to kick in but.....no....not a single solitary thing.
