I learned in 2 days why they call it hippie crack.<BR>
  <BR>
It was the second week before school got out. I had been talking to one of my friends who was graduating (super senior).  He had been telling me about his experiences with whipits.  The more I heard, the more I wanted to try them.<BR>
<BR>
I finally asked him if he would pick me up some (me being a minor and all).  That day when I went home I decided to research whippits a bit, and for the most part I only heard good things. So the next day I blew what money I had laying around plus my lunch money on a brown bag containing one charger (cracker, popper) and twenty-four nitrous filled containers intended solely for whipped cream use.  I now could hardly wait to get home and experience what I had only heard about.<BR>
<BR>
The experience was unexplainable.  I only did one more after that, and decided I could just do 3 or less every couple of days. I thought wrong. I was unable to throw myself into a pool of white noise and numbness that weekend, nor did I really even have a craving or anything for them.  When I returned home from school that rainy-ass monday my obvious reaction was to break out about 3 whippits and relax on the couch, watch TV, and finish up pizza from the previous night.<BR>
<BR>
After the three, I realized that nothing was stopping me from going up and getting 3 more whippits.  I had plenty more, and after those I would just stop.  It wasn't like I had to or like I felt as if I couldn't go without another, I just did.  It's now 5:30, I started around 3:00 and by my own half conscious addition I now have 17 empty whippit catriges next to me.  FUCK! There goes all except about 4 whippits left.  There goes almost $40 in one day.  FUCK! The thing was, I didn't feel like I was addicted.  The moral:  if you do try whipits, try them with some friends.  That way you'll do less and spend less.
