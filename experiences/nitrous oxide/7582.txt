Every time I had gone into town with my friends, my one friend would go into this shady store and get hooked up with whip-its, and he would take the shit on the streets with a baloon and cracker and it got me a little curious.<BR>
<BR>
So one day, me, the kid, and another friend went to town, and he got some whip-its, and we took them back to his house.  We went right in the living room and since his parents weren't home, he had out porno, weed and other crazy shit. Then he gave me one.<BR>
<BR>
Then he took a hit and got really fucked up.  I was getting really anxious.  Then he did a couple more, and handed me the cracker.  I had watched him, so I knew how, and I filled a balloon, blew out all my breath, and inhaled the whole balloon, and held it in.<BR>
<BR>
After a few seconds, I blew it out, and thats when I felt it.  I could tell right away that I was fucked up.  The first thing was sound that I noticed.  My friend had his guitar on amp, and was playing crazy shit using the metal nitrous bulb.  The noise was out of this world.  So choppy and amazing, like the sound was physical.  I could feel the sound, it was so weird.  Then I noticed the numbness.  I could feel still, only all tingly everywhere, like I was a ghost.<BR>
<BR>
Just the over all perspective of everything was cool as shit, and I wanted to fall on his coffee table.  Walking around was cool too.  My steps vibrated and made cool noises when I walked.<BR>
<BR>
But then before I knew it, (about a minute, two tops) the feeling was going and as I returned to reality I was like 'What the fuck dude!  That was better than dank!'<BR>
<BR>
After that day (about a week ago) I've gotten about 4 other friends to do it.
