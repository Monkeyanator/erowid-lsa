It was my first year of highschool and I had joined the wrestling teem.<BR>
<BR>
After several practices I realized it wasn't really as fun as it looked but decided to give it one more chance and go to a tournament. We arrived after riding in a cramped schoolbus for 5 hours. After finding a spot on the floor for my sleeping bag (In a school gym), I had a few practice rounds before the tournament would start.<BR>
<BR>
First round and I was on my back with my knee twisted. My patella had been dislocated. I lay still there on the mat with a crowd around and eventually the paramedics came in.<BR>
<BR>
I told them it really hurt to move so the brought out the nitrous!<BR>
<BR>
It was a tank which I was told was 50-50 with Nitrous and Oxygen. I started breathing with a mask over my head. Nothing happened for a while and after seeing people use laughing gas on TV I expected to break into an outrage of hysterical laughter. I was quite disappointed, and when I was about to settle down and accept the idea I wasn't going to get high, it hit me!<BR>
<BR>
This was actually my first experience with any drug (I have since taken mushroom, canabis, and a very weak form of an attempted Phalaris extraction of DMT. It worked a bit, but was nowhere near the experiences I read.) and I was taken completely by surprise.<BR>
<BR>
I just started to notice I was getting lightheaded when my image of the world became a blur. I couldn't think straight, and all I can remember is suddenly starting to laugh. I looked around me at the crowd, and saw strange trails being left behind by everything I looked at. It was like those anoying mouse trails you can turn on on your computer. If you have ever seen an attempted recreation of a drug experience on TV, where everything is double imaged and echos, that was my trip. I remember getting enough breath together to mutter 'Everything is echoing!'. This is when the ambulance attendants and the onlookers burst into laughter. It was almost scary. I heard echoing, creepy laughter like a pack of hyenas and my vision was so distorted I couldn't make sense of it all. It should have scared me but it only drove me deeper into a frenzy of laughter. The more I laughed, the more they laughed and the cycle went on and on until I actually had to get my act together enough to pull the mask off of my face and get some air. I thought I was going to die because with all the laughing I never had a chance to take a breath.<BR>
<BR>
The moment I took my mask off I started calming down. They said the were going to lift me onto the gurney but my knee had already started to hurt again.  So i strapped my mask back on and once again entered the wonderful world of nitrous.<BR>
<BR>
Being caried to the ambulance was fun also, but nothing compared to the crazy antics of the gymnasium floor. The attendant eventually told me to take the mask off, saying I didn't need any more. He afterwards congradulated me on draining an entire tank.<BR>
<BR>
After reading about the combination of mushrooms and nitrous, i can guarnatee you, next time i get twisted, i'm bringing along a baloon or two.
