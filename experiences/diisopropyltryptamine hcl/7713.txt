Of course, since I am a jazz drummer by trade I just had to sample DIPT.(You know why!! Was that an augmented major seventh chord functioning as a Lydian dominant? I sure hope so!) Anywho, I took God only knows (I wonder if it cares?) how many milligrams, estimates based on previous experience with 5-Meo-DIPT +/- 80mg, which is slightly heavier mole wise (That's 6.04 x 10 to the 23rd power, leaving quite a skeptical dosage, although I love it when that 23 pops up again and again ...... ad naseum .... I need to sell some books....)<BR>

Anywho (the fuck am I), this was planned around a park trip (he he) involving a frisbee and a middle eastern frame drum. Frisbee control was nice, playing the frame drum was more beautiful than usual, then I remembered I had to play a gig with an organ trio in a couple of hours. (Slick, take an auditory hallucinogen a couple of hours before you have to play some kung fu/what the hell is going on?! type of jazz. (So what's the problem?)<BR>

Apparently, there wasn't any problem. I did not notice any harmonic distortions with respect to dischordance or non-matching impressions of harmonic overtone content of chord structures, but there was a definate downshift of people's voices and a signature tryptamine buzz in the psyche. After realizing that I am Master of My reality (what a ridiculous concept) I went to my gig and, coincidentally or not, (who cares, really) I must say I played my arse nearly off. It was not unlike the musical powers which the foxy methoxy instilled in me, even though it was totally unlike the musical powers which the foxy instills in me.<BR>

Definately some enhancement of the attention/focus/am I unconciously doing some weird yoga thing I haven't learned yet? type faculty, which is nearly always present in my flow of conciousness. No heavy stuff, but I would encourage all musicians to take this ride. Only pay attention to where the DIPT train is going  so you don't accidentally get off at the wrong station.  <BR>
Love Ya,<BR>
