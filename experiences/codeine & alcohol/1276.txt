This was my third and probably best experience with codeine. I still had pills left over from when i had wisdom tooth extraction, and I had been using them as shortcuts to getting totally ripped by combining them with alcohol, especially when I was broke. On this instance, I was a frat party with a bunch of my girlfriends. I took two pills at around 11:00 p.m. or so, and proceeded to have several drinks: a Sex on the Beach, whiskey sour, a poorly made Zombie, and a very disgusting Tequila Sunrise. Mind you, I drank these over the course of the nite, not all at once! <BR>

It took about 40 minutes before I started feeling the distinct codeine buzz: kind of out of nowhere, you start to feel real happy and mellow, and drunk, but in a more clearheaded, unsloppy sort of way. You don't get those heavy legs or slurring words, and your balance is seemingly unaffected. This time around, however, I experienced an additional effect I had not previously experienced: my body felt good, similar to ecstasy but obviously not as intense. This lasted for a good portion of the night, and it felt great. This is the one very noticeable and unpleasant things about doing codeine, though: you can tell the very instant your buzz is going away. It's not gradual at all; all of a sudden, boom, the ride is over, and then all you feel is extremely hammered and heavy. And the worst part: the nausea kicks in, and it doesn't go lightly on you either. At the point this occurred, I ate this ham and cheese sandwhich (which tasted unusually delicious for some reason)and for a few minutes I felt better, but then the nausea came right back. Then I had hiccups for about 45 minutes, and was generally in a gross mood. Everyone else was drunk and annoying me half to death. <BR>

The whole ride lasted maybe four hours. Then i dragged myself home and passed out, still feeling so nauseous that I wished i had never heard of codeine. The next day I felt exhausted, but personally, I attribute this a lot more to the alcohol than the codeine. Alcohol always makes me feel like crap the next day. I still have not taken codeine by itself. However, if you are going to drink with it, i wouldn't recommed taking a greater dose than the 30 mg. I am pretty sure that anything more would have had me throwing up all night. All in all, though, I am sick of codeine. Personally, the nausea just ruins it for me. I like more intense mind blowing things like geltabs and good ecstasy better; I don't drink very often and don't go for downers and tranquilizers. However, if things like valium and percoset are your thing, give codeine a try; you may like it as well.
