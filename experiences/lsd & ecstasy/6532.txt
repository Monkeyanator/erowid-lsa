My first time 'candy-flipping' was one of the the oddest drug experiences Ive ever had.<BR>
<BR>
To start with I took 2 hits of LSD at about one a.m.  I immediately got extremly giggly and couldnt move bc I was laughing so hard.  I thought that everything I looked at was alive and that I was having some sort of private joke with them that only I could understand.<BR>
<BR>
Our Ecstacy didnt arrive ontime so at about 4 oclock I took another hit. About 45 minuets later my senses felt completly overloaded.  I had to remain sitting bc the visuals were so powerful and I felt dizzy.  Everything was moving, and I felt very perceptive to peoples emotions.  I *knew* I could sense what people were thinking, and even though my friends were being friendly I could read their thoughts and knew that they were thinking other things about me...20 minutes later I was sitting in the back of a moving vehicle.  I felt like the whole world was revolving around me and it was at this time that the visuals got very intense.  The clouds were forming shapes (which I could control) and i got very nervous and it was hard to breath.<BR>
<BR>
About 30 minuets later my friend and I took our e and 15 minuets after that I started feeling very nice and friendly and warm to everyone for a little over an hour.  I felt cuddly and very open and honest.  I went for a walk and suddenly its like all the drugs hit me again at once.  I got very withdrawn and was overcome by the visuals I was having.  I felt unable to talk and my thoughts were moving so fast that they wouldnt fit into words.  Its like I was speaking a foreign launguage.  I couldnt process anything that anyone was saying. My mind went completly blank.  When my friend went to give me a hug, it was as if the LSD took over and I wanted to hug them back but I pushed them away in disquest.  <BR>

The rest of that day I felt very withdrawn and alone.  I was in my own world and analyzing everything in my mind.  It was a very melancholy feeling.  I still couldnt talk for most of the day or express myself at all.
