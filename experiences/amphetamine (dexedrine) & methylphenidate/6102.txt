<!--more for my prescription amph abuse by teens collection--><BR>
<BR>
Ok, to start off i'll just say that i have been using different types of amphetamines for the past 3 months after my friend (lets just call him M) introduced me to my first dose of 25 miligrams of ritalin. i took it at 9:40 in school during break, and by 10:15 in ceramics class i was feeling very speedy and euphoric. i loved it! <BR>
                                                                    anyways, the next day my other friend (S) gave me a full prescription bottle of ritalin. there were 10mg tabs and 20 mg tabs. another friend hooked me up with street speed (significantly stronger than prescription ampthetamines) this made me incredibly happy, throughout the next month or so i used up to 200mg's of ritalin within 4 hours every day, trying to get a better and better high, very recently another friend (A) gave me 20mg of dexedrine which i decided to pop 10mg at a time. for a while i felt good, but i started talkin with some other friends about our problems etc. this got me thinking about how much i have fucked up my family, my friends and my own life. since then (2 days ago) i have taken approximately 400mg of ritalin and im all out.                                                                what i am trying to say is that, for all of you out there who havent done amphetamines/methamphetamines...stay away from them. i strongly advise you not to. i had fun for the first 2 weeks, then when i started to become addicted, i wasnt myself without it. i have caused my family hell, and i have fucked up my own life. my parents are sending me off to boarding school after this summer, my grades in school were up for a while but are now incredibly low, i am losing friends by the second, and my own brother wont even tlak to me anymore becuz i have scared him so much.                                                                                                                                   Message of this seemingly pointless story of my amphetamine addiction: Take care when you try any type of speed, and if you like it, remind yourself how addictive it is and no matter how much you like it, make it a once a lifetime thing. I know im making it sound like it's as addictive as crack, and i know it isnt, but this addiction has given me hell. Please learn a lesson from my mistakes and dont end up in my situation.
