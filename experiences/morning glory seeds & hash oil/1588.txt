This was my roommate's and I's first time every taking MG.  I'm still stoned as I write this so It may not make much sense but I'll try.  I'll dispense the info to you in chronicological order.<BR>

<DT>1600 - took two packets of morning glory seeds<BR>
<DT>1700 - slight 'haze if the braiz' if you know what I mean. Limbs felt a bit heavy.  Also getting pretty tired.<BR>
<DT>1800 - same as 1700<BR>
<DT>1900 - starting to get a bit of a mushroomy kinda buzz to it. getting kinda restless.  <BR>
<DT>2000 - bought the hash oil cause we wanted to get things going.  Once we smoked a couple hoots we were really fucked up.  It was like a total crazy mushroom buzz.  It was like I took about 4 - 4.5 grams of good mush.  I really liked it.  <BR>
<DT>2200 - Mushroom buzz is gone but still really stoned.<BR>

Then I just got really stoned and I think the feelings from the seeds are gone.  I'm writing this still stoned @ 0400 that night (morning).  I hope this is helpfull.  I don't think I will do the seeds ever on their own.  I've done acid before and it was nothing like that.  I think the THC really helped us.  We both would do it again with THC down the road.  But we didn't like the initial buzz so we don't it for a while.  It's worth trying but I think it really varies from person to person on what it will do to you.
