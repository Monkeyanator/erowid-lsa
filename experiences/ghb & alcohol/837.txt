I have multiple experiences with drugs and can only recommend that everyone be very careful with this newer drug.  I am a very capable drinker and have used almost all drugs and had very few ill effects until, I got the geebers.  I had approximately 15 cocktails of a mixed variety (beer, liqour and wine).  I then ran into some friends in a club who passed me some G.  I had used this drug approximately 20 times over 3 years before and had only positive results.  Apparently, I drank over half a bottle, and began the vomiting, convulsing effect others have described.  If not for some friends who called my roommates, I would have ended up in the local jail or detox earlier.  However, after about an hour of vomiting I was placed in the bed of my roommate's truck to go home.  The next part of this story is one of the most unbelievable acts I have ever heard of, let alone been part of.  While on the way to my house, I awoke and stood in the bed of the truck.  I assumed a surfing demeaner until I thought it would be all right to 'fly' from the truck.  I was retrieved from the highway by my roommate and taken home in an immense amount of pain.  After about six hours I was taken to a local hospital and treated for a snapped humerous.  I am lucky to have lived through this expressway diving incident and have yet to find any others that have hallucinated to the point I did that night.  As I forward this tale I am currently still using this drug.  After $3000 in medical expenses, I still enjoy this buzz and can only offer this advice, 'Moderation.'
