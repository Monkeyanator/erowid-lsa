After being the last of my friends to try this new drug I sorta knew what to expect. It was friday and I knew it was time to pop the 16mg capsule. I was waiting to try it because I wanted to do it with my girlfriend. We both decided that we would do it around 3:00 pm, since many of my friends has some insomnia folowing their journey. <BR>
<BR>
3pm. Downed the pill with some water. I had eaten lunch at noon, and felt my stomach still had something in it. Around 20 minutes I started to feel something. I knew something was up, but I wasnt sure what. I started to feel a little tired so I layed down on the couch just watching T.V.   Meanwhile my girlfriend, said she didnt really feel anything but a little drowsy.<BR>
<BR>
It was 3:50 and I layed up, and started rubbing my feet on the carpet. Man did that feel good. I felt like my sense of touch just tripled in sensitivity. 10 minutes later BOOM. I was up and man i got this energy rush like I couldnt imagine. My mind felt like i just smoked a shit load of Pot, but on a different level. I wanted to do everything at once. I couldnt decide. I wanted to go outside, I wanted to sit down, I wanted to do everything right at that second. So having all this energy I grabbed my shoes and ran outside in the cold afternoon. I felt like I had no concerns no problems, I just had to do something else besides sit inside.<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, my girlfriend was still on the couch, not really feeling anything at all. So after 1 hour and 15 minutes she decided to take another 12 Mg capsule. <BR>
<BR>
I came back inside and sprawled out on the floor starring at the ceiling. For the first time in my life i saw my first open-eyed visual. The fan on the ceiling was still. After looking at it for a couple seconds, the blades started to droop down at me and go back up. It was the coolest thing ive ever seen. The ceiling looked like a million little snakes swimming to the beat of the music we were playing. Just as I was blissfully laying on the floor, my girlfriend bounced off the couch and felt a huge surge of energy, and body buzz like me. <BR>
<BR>
2.5 hours in still feel like I'm not at my peak yet. Everything just keeps getting better and better. Now for the biggest shock. I went to call my friend, when I picked up the phone. The dial tone was completely off. You've listen to a dial tone your whole life, but when it is just a couple keys too low, you know it. It was wierd. I freaked out and ran to my next door neighbors to listen to their dial tone. I just notcied everything sounded lower than usual. Songs that you know by heart, sounded way wrong. But as soon as I accepted it it was pretty cool. <BR>
<BR>
My girlfriend was still laying on the floor starring at the celing. She said she couldnt move. She had a huge smile on her face and didnt want to get up. I wanted to go to my friends apartment next door, but she just wanted to lay there. After another hour it was almost 7 pm, she finally got up and we walked to my friends APT. We sat there with them just look around the room. Many cool things I noticed. When my girlfriend and I put our feet together, it felt like they became one. Alot of times I would feel as if I was melting into the couch, I became the couch. <BR>
<BR>
At a higher dose like she took. The open-eyed visuals were amazing she said. She saw things move. She reported the carpet having a heartbeat, and seeing millions of little people on the ceiling dancing to the beat of the music. She seemed to peak later than me and was very impressed.<BR>
<BR>
We went back to my apt. later and layed around while it slowly wore off for another 4-5 hours. The comedown was excellent. Not like MDMA, but very gradual. We layed in my bed. And both felt very senually attracted. Sex was great not on a physical level but on a emotional and sensual level. The feeling of connectedness was amazing.<BR>
<BR>
All in all we fell alseep fine around 2 am. No side affects at all. No nausea. Felt a bit out of it the next day. But all in all it was a great experience!<BR>
<BR>
Cant wait to try again!<BR>
