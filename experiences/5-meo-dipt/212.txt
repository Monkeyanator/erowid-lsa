A while ago I bought some 5-MeO-DIPT from an online source. When I first got it, I was surprised at how small it was (250 mg). I don't have a scale that can measure in milligrams so I dumped about 1/3 of the powder in 4 tablespoons of water. At first attempt, I drank 1/2 Tbsp of the bitter solution. The effects were a light tryptamine sensation and slight difficulty being coherent as I was told by friends. <BR>

A few weeks later I downed a tablespoon of the remaining 3 and 1/3 tablespoons, which I kept sealed in a jar in the fridge. That was about 2:30 p.m. I went outside and toated a joint.<BR>

At about 3:00, I measured 5 mL (1/2 teaspoon) and downed that. At 3:30, I felt a little wierd and felt like I could read my dog's mind. By 4:15, my jeans were doing the swirling thing that happens on acid. I felt euphoric, vertigo, and every inanimate object seemeed to be alive. I smoked a small bowl of cheap weed which seemed to bring me down. <BR>

I remembered that I had to go to the library to work on a report, so I had my mom drive me just in case. I was disappointed that I had come down so much until we started driving. My seatbelt was trying to squeeze me tight and I felt too big for the car. Which led to paranoia, which led to uncontrollable laughter. Everything in my field of view seemed to have so much charactor and amazing detail. Even the underground parking lot seemed so adventurous, like being in a cave. When I went in, I asked the librarian to use the internet, but couldn't understand her reply. I felt like everybody was staring at me and giving me dirty looks. I didn't get any work done. By 7:30 I was at baseline. This stuff can be fatal when too much is taken, so don't be a dumbass and eyeball it like I did. From what I hear, over 25 milligrams is too much.
