An interesting note on FMethoxy. During my first dose over 25 mg, I noticed all sounds had a lower pitch. Much lower. During most trips where I dosed over 20 mgs, and all trips where I dose over 30 mgs, I have noticed the same effect. Two other people that I know experienced the same thing. None of the reports or faqs on FMethoxy reported this, which I found it strange, thus I am writing this little note. Minutes ago, while reading the TiHKAL entry on DIPT, I saw reported that it is a common effect with that drug. I suppose that's what is happening to me and my friends.<BR>

By and by, I find I get the best visual trip out of the drug with oral doses between 25 and 50 mgs. But 15 mgs is just fine if I'm looking to boost my mood. First time users can get a pretty good idea about the drug at 10 mgs. I also caution not to go to 60 mgs or over. Just way too much vomiting for my taste.<BR>

My first experience with FMethoxy was at 12 mgs with 1.75 mgs of GBL. I fell in love with it quickly. The trip was not very visual, but there was a great synergy between the two chemicals, producing a very exuberant high. I had all this energy, was very very happy, and was in a pleasure over load. I was rolling around the floor, feeling everything. The cold rubber sole of a tennis shoe against my arm, a fuzzy blanket against my face, ice cubes across my chest, etc. Very tactile, but not nescarily sexualy stimulating. Just everything felt amazingly good to touch. I felt warm all over, and had to turn on the air conditioner to feel comfortable even though the room wasn't actualy hot.<BR>

Most FMethoxy trips I have had are not nearly as pleasurable/tactile, except when I take GBL with it. GBL really adds something to the low does trips. When I dose higher, I am looking for a different kind of experience, and don't use any GBL.
