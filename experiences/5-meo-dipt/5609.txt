I had the opportunity to try it, after four weeks ago, having tried 2C-7-T and really liking it. I expected that this 'foxy' stuff would be a lot less intense and smoother and that maybe I would have some great sex on it with the guy I took it with. None of that ever happened.<BR>
<BR>
My day started off with eating a pretty high caliber pot brownie and then later, before my friend and I drove off to some party in the mountains, I had another big brownie as an after dinner treat. I was pretty baked by the time I got to the party. It was a good freak-show of friends and costumes and errant psychic mayhem, but after two triple-shot, tall glasses of whiskey and Coke, I was bored and cranky. I grabbed my date and he wanted to leave as well so we did and dropped just 10 mg each of the 5-MeO-DiPT in the car on the way home. <BR>
<BR>
I could feel it kick in in about twenty minutes with subtle body rushes accompanied by very slight distortions in temporal perceptions of the road and the headlights, as a passenger in a car. About twenty minutes or so into it and almost home, I started to feel really rushed out -  as in my body just felt tingly and strange and I felt kind of wound up although I didn't quite feel speeded out or anything like I can get with Extacy sometimes - except this didn't have the benefit of the E euphoria at all. <BR>
<BR>
We got home and decided to take my dog to the park at 1 in the morning. The walk was nice and moving helped direct this ball of energy I had welling up in me. I noticed too that both my friend aI seemed like we were walking a little to the side or stumbling slightly almost. On our walk, I continued to notice a heightening sense of tension that I and couldn't quite figure out. It was in my body and yet my body felt really gelled out and when I would stop to see if I had any hand tremors, there were none. It was a very strange disassociative type body reaction. It was like I was split off and having two separate reactions at the same time. I didn't quite know what to make of it. <BR>
<BR>
On our way back home, I noticed slight visual distortions around shadows and long distances ( like looking down an alley for a couple of blocks). Lots of shadows coming out of the shadows and a slight amount of paranoia had set in too (2 a.m. not a great neighborhood - weird noises seemed pronounced). When we did get home, I realized the tension in my body, was really not comfortable to the point of becoming unbearable. Since I could not really figure out if it was in my mind or not, I feel I spent the rest of the night  trying to see if i could understand what the whole buzz was doing so I could at least try and master it rather than let the body buzz get the better of me. My friend had to remind me too that that is exactly what I needed to do. He is more of a veteran at this stuff and I am more of a reborn veteran these days. <BR>
<BR>
For a while I felt a very erotic sense of stimulation in my genital area but that soon gave way to a feeling of being really anxious and almost short of breath. My friend said he was not sure what he was really feeling either and took some time to try and talk me out of having a panic attack. I finally took an Ativan (an anti-anxiety med) to see if would help take the edge off and instead I ended up with some serious visual hallucinations such as the walls and books in the bookcase bending, sparks of different colors darting by my peripheral vision quite often.  If I really focused on something, the visuals were actually quite intense. <BR>
<BR>
About two hours into it, I noticed that my back was really really sore and so I drew a hot bath and soaked in that for a while and then we went outside where I spun some poi and I noticed that being outside (it was a lovely full moon night too) really seemed to help make it better and the moving my body helped too. I could really feel the energy of Gaia outside on this stuff and the trees seemed to be supporting me.  <BR>
<BR>
When we got back inside both of us started to laugh because we realized we had been standing around my kitchen just totally spacing out. I found a muscle relaxant, Zaniflex, and took half of that and felt much better - actually kind of slept most of the rest of the trip off. I could have tried to have sex but my body felt so weird and the back pain so immense, that I just could not get turned on. As well, I felt that the sense of empathy I have had with this guy I have been dating (who I took this with), was gone and replaced by fears that he would see how badly I was handling this drug and that I would ruin his trip or change his opinion about me permanently. At least he seemed to have some great insightful things to tell me about myself that I try not to let anyone see. That was kind of disconcerting. <BR>
<BR>
We did not have sex last night. I was in a really weird headspace and I could tell that he was trying to get a grip on it too and to manage his own impression of me having kind of a freaky time with it. I didn't ruin the evening for him, and I did get a grip, but for a while there, I didn't feel so happy to have taken 5-MeO-DiPT. My back hurt and I couldn't relax the tension in my body. <BR>
<BR>
I do not think I would try it again. It seemed a waste of time just feeling uncomfortable and not quite knowing how to get into the flow of it or how to relate to the other person as well. I found it to be a very alienating, awkward experience that I could not control until I had taken enough sedatives and done enough to loosen my body up.<BR>
<BR>
As I write this, I have woken up, my friend still asleep and I am drinking coffee and smoking some weed and I feel pretty good now about 10 hours later - still seeing some slight visual residue around things and feeling a lot calmer and more hopeful that today will be better than last night was. <BR>
<BR>
I would not be totally opposed to trying 5-MeO-DiPT again, as it could have been affected by the head-space I had going into it, the brownies I had eaten the day before, and the alcohol that had already put me in a salty mood by midnight. Overall though, I'd rather take something else. This was not that fun and like I said, I spent most of my night (and so did my friend actually although he was said he was 'feeling no pain') trying to figure out what the buzz really was and how to get into it. It was hard not to, it was that odd and intense, yet not mind-blowing enough to put up with and have fun with it. <BR>
<BR>
I am actually looking forward to my day of 5-MeO-DiPT aftereffects ahead. I still feel it in my system but I feel pretty good. Maybe it is time to go wake up the boy in my bed afterall! ;)
