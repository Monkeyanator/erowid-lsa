I had Recently done benadryl about 6 times before at low doses but now I heard from your site that the more you take the better it gets so I had to try it. I woke up early that morning (January 3rd) on on empty stomach, I popped 12 pills at 9:00am. After ahout an hour I started to feel the Benadryl buzz coming on,(light headed, spacey feeling) and popped 12 more for a total of 24 pills (600mg.) and waited another hour. I was watching T.v. at about 11:15 when the trip started to set in. I felt as if someone had lifted me off the bed and carried me around. The feeling was awesome. <BR>

I got up and found that it was hard to walk and somehow got the my CD player, and put in NIRVANA 'NEVERMIND' cd. It was now 11:30 and when I got to the 6th song on the cd I kept hearing beeping coming from the song. At first I thought that something was wrong with my CD, so I stopped it and took it out and played with it for like an hour. The shiny part on the CD was weird if I stared at it, and Isaw a fly land on it and then it dissapeared. I put the Cd down and went to the bathroom. On the way there I saw my friend B at the door and when I went to answer him he was gone. It was so real I actually thought he was there. In the bathroom I talked to smeone in the mirror but he just dissapeared to. Finally I got angry at went back to my room. I sat down and heard something talking about going to work outside my windoqw and when I opened it, there were three people standing in my backyard. There I was in the dead of winter opening my window and I yelled 'get out of there' but before I could finish saying it the vanished into the tree. <BR>

It was like 12:40 now and I turned around to turn on the T.V and my CD rack seriously turned into my friend's head and started talking to me, but I don't rememember what it said. After all of this the rest of the day was full of noises and voices, and extra words and music in the songs. Finally at about 3:00pm I fell asleep, and I woke up near midnight, still buzzing but not tripping. <BR>

I learned that you do hallucinate badly from this stuff, and that if you are lokking to slip into a new world for a while this is your ticket.
