I've always had these benadryl pills sitting in my desk. One day i looked on the back and thought the active indgrediant seemed familiar. I finally found it here on the drammine faq. So I popped in all 12 pills at a time. 45 minutes later i felt this uge buzz come over me than leae almost instantly. I got up and almost blacked out. I lied back down on the couch for awhile than got up to get a drink since my throat and mouth were really dry. <BR>

When i was standing i felt like someone had turned up the gravity like ten times. Walking was almost impossible i thought my knees were gonna buckle any second. I got a hi-c from the fridge and tried to drink it. I could barely even suck in any liquid it was so hard and felt really weird. <BR>
Whenever i tried to talk my voice was so weak i could barley make a sound. I got this overwhelming feeling and decided to lie down. It started getting hard to breath and my heart beat was goin REALLY REALLY fast. I also kept hearing these strange voices even though no one was in the room. Than i heard footsteps and saw this person come in my room but than he dissapeared. I wanted to just get to sleep cause this feeling is very uncomfortable. It seemed like i was in a dream and at one point there was this huge book in front of my face but i realized i had my eyes closed. When i closed my eyes i could still see everything but in a different way. I finally fell asleep and my dad woke me up and later on he told me i was muttering something aobut mushrooms and some guy named Rolando. This may seem cool but trust me the feeling you get is far from it.
