About 3 weeks ago, I was reading up on the internet about diphenhydramine (Benadryl allergy medicine) and how you can trip on them. I have never had any hallucinogens, so I can't compare the visuals with much. I though what the hell and took a go for it. I spent most of this time on the computer on IRC waiting for the pills to kick in. It was a Sunday night and I was alone. <BR>
<BR>
10:00pm- took 20 pills<BR>
<BR>
10:30pm- nothing<BR>
<BR>
11:00- still nothing....took another 5 pills thinking I didn't take enough<BR>
<BR>
11:30- little moving jelly things in the air. Kind of like the alien from Predator.<BR>
<BR>
12:00am- Starting to get pissed off then HOLY SHIT! I weigh a million pounds and everything seems weird. I can't seem to have a very good concept of time from here on out. Everything seemed like a dream. Not a bad or good dream...just a really fucked up dream. I had weird fuckin visuals. Unlike acid visuals, from what I heard, which u can pretty much tell whats real and whats not and u get all sorts of cool shapes and colors, I could not tell the difference between visuals and the real world. The first major one was  a glass of water that I was trying to pick up for a while until something happened and it vanished. Another thing, this shit made me VERY thirsty and dehydrated me. I kept seeing these fake glasses of water in different rooms of the house. <BR>
<BR>
2:00am- Went to bed. The only reason I remembered the time is because I looked at my alarm clock for some reason. While I was laying in bed, I looked over at the wall (right next to the bed) and saw a door and a doorknob. I kept trying to reach for the doorknob to open the door (didn't know why), but my hand kept passing though this. I couldn't figure this out. It was a little while later until I realized that there was no door....not even a wall...the closest wall was about 5 feet away from the bed. I turned the light off and tried to fall asleep. I couldn't fall asleep because I couldn't stay still....my body didn't seem right. I had that feeling like I just had to keep moving or I'd freek out....I freaked out anyways. I remember hearing voices and moaning and I was saying some shit like 'Why the fuck is this going on!' over and over until the noises stopped.<BR>
<BR>
2:30am- I think I fell asleep somewhere around this time cause the last time I looked at the clock it was about 2:20am and I don't remember anything after that.<BR>
<BR>
The next morning I woke up and got out of bed for school. I collapsed the second I stood up. I made it to my feet and I still felt like I weighed a million pounds. I made it to school and plopped down by my friends in the hall. They asked me what was a matter with me and all I said was 'don't fuckin talk to me.' <BR>
<BR>
This was not a happy, colorful, fun trip. It was more of the fucked up dreams you get before you wake up all hot, sweaty, and thirsty when you have the flu. It was worth the experience and I don't regret doing it, but I'm not sure if I would want to do it again.
