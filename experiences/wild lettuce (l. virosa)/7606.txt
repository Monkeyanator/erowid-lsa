When I ran across Opium Lettuce on the internet I thought 'cool a legal opium type buzz, I'm there.'  The stuff I got in the mail looked like lawn clipings, I smoked a joint of it and it tasted like lawn clippings.  I looked up on the internet to make an extract out of this.  I put it in a jar with water and I froze and defrosted several times to weaken the cell structure.  I then boiled and let stand overnight; strained and evaporated over a low flame.  I came out of it with a little residue with a tecture like hash,  I smoked it and felt a minor buzz.  The buzz was very minor.  The taste was not bad and the smoke did not stink.  My distilation process produced very little of the substance so I took the plant substance I strained, soaked in water, put through a vegtable juicer, and then evaporated the juice.  This time it produced quite a bit of the substance with the hash like tecture.  My advise, dont waste your time with this stuff, the buzz if any is minimal.
