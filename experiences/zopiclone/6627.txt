I had just finished an extremely exhausting day at work and was in search for something that might bring me down from the immense frustration I had had at work that day. My choices were alcohol, ganja or rhovane/zopiclone. Since I had been doing a fair amount of the first 2 options in the last few week, I decided to take a couple pills of zopiclone, which is prescribed for sleeping problems like insomnia.<BR>

I took the pills at approximately 11 o'clock, and by 11:30 I could feeling the first effects kicking in. It wasn't strong, but it was almost like a mild alcohol buzz. By about 12 I reached the peak of the experience. I felt a little drunk, my muscles felt quite relaxed, which was nice, there was very mild euphoria. I felt a little drowsy, but not so much that I had to go to bed right away. Walking was interesting and rather difficult; I had lost a certain degree of coordination and it was difficult for me to avoid bumping in to walls  :)   My muscles just felt quite heavy. Mentally, not much went on, I just felt sort of serene, yet calm and relaxed. Not as much thinking and worrying was going on in my mind as it usulay does.<BR>
<BR>
All in all I'd say it was a decent night, nothing I'd want to start doing habitually, but it was a nice relaxing drug which I was in great need of. Just don't take more than 2 pills because you could suffer severe discoordination and a bit of amnesthia as well. Thanks for listening and peace.<BR>
