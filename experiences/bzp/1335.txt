A FOAF converted freebase Benzylpiperazine to the HCl salt and tried it.<BR>
<BR>
<U>Effects:</U><BR>
<BR>
Trial 1: 140 mg orally <BR>
Took in capsule. Hit me after 1.25 hours.  A lot of speed with mild to medium euphoria.  Peaked about 1.25 after it first hit.  Fast and not-too-pleasant comedown.<BR>
<BR>
Trial 2: Keybones after an oral dose<BR>
After the 140 mg oral dose came down completely, the FOAF felt tired. So the FOAF had several key bones every once in a while.  While sober, snorting BZP hurts a lot.  But after taking the chemical orally, the pain was reduced tremendously.<BR>
 <BR>
Trial 3:  200-250 mg orally and them smoking powder on top of MJ.<BR>
-doesn't taste very bad.  Kinda soapy<BR>
-noticable rush (resembles ice rush)<BR>
-mad euphoria but feel a little stoned<BR>
-MJ effects feel stronger and the drugs extend the lives of each other<BR>
-feels kind of like rolling (musically)<BR>
-Bad: pressure on chest (mildly unpleasant): fast heartbeat?  pain (just can't notice it because messed up)?<BR>
-Bad:sore throat: corrosive<BR>
-Bad: cotton mouth (increased due to sore throat)<BR>
     <BR>
<U>Question:</U> What causes pressure on chest?  Is it something bad?
