I thought I'd addd a note about Harmala & Cactus.  I think this combination is OK. I've done a kilo (fresh weight) of San Pedro with 3 grams of Rue; had good potentiation (full Shulgin +3.0; same amount of cactus w/o Rue was sub-threshold +2.3 or so). My wife's done it; I've talked to a few others who have done it; Ott mentions this combo in Ayahuasca Analogs; Naranjo mentions in The Healing Journey.<BR>

However, YBPMV; I didn't check my BP before and after (should have), so it's possible there could be problems, especially for someone with high BP to begin with. Also, I would not try with any MAOI except harmine/harmaline.
