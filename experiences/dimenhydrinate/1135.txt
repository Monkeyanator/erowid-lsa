Last night at around 11 I decided to try Dramamine. I had previously read that you could get effects off the drug that would be similar to those of LSD or mushrooms.<BR>
<BR>
Starting at 11 I took 5 pills, then again at 11:15 I took the next 5.  Nothing happened for about 40-50 minutes, but then at around 12:00 or a little after I noticed that everything seemed to have a glow to it. The glow was almost like what you could call an aura. This lasted about an hour and then seemed to heighten.  Then at around 1:15 I noticed my walls had formed veins and had a pulse. So I turned on my blacklight to make sure that I could have some view of my room. This worked well, but I noticed that the stick-on glowing eyes started to shift positions and blink. So very frantically I turned off my blacklight. Once the blacklight was off I laid back down on my bed and continued to stare at my walls and ceiling.<BR>

Then very quickly I sat up and noticed that a boy was sitting indian-style on my floor. He then proceeded to have a conversation about apples and bananas. This boy was not someone that I had known or had ever come in contact with. Then I turned away to look at the clock and when I looked back he was gone. It was now 2:40 and I still was not at the peak of my trip. Then I started to hear the noises of frogs and birds inside my room. So, thinking that these noises were coming from outside, I proceeded to get up and look out the window. But once I stood up, I noticed that my window was open. When I went to close it, I reached for the top of the window and then realized that the window was closed after all.<BR>
<BR>
Then at around 3:00 I was feeling a bit nauseated so I decided to try and sleep off the effects.  All this did was heighten my senses (with the exception of sight). I did, in fact, get some awesome CEV (closed eye visuals). Then out of nowhere I felt as if I was going to puke. Now, I don't really like to puke in my house without the presence of my mother or father. So, I got my mom and told her I was going into the bathroom to throw up. So my mom came in and started to console me by rubbing my back and head. I was sweating so much that the sweat was dripping off of my chin and down my back in giant drops. I never did throw up, but after about 30 or 40 minutes the feeling went away.<BR>
<BR>
I went back to bed and tried to sleep.  My mom brought me in a washcloth with cold water on it and placed it on my face.  This helped me alot, it controlled my CEV and even my open eye visuals. Once I was relaxed I finally fell asleep. I awoke today at around 10:30. It is now 5:30pm and I'm still having a lost sense of reality and some CEV.<BR>

To all of those people that are thinking about trying this method of tripping, I strongly do not recommend it at all. It is not a drug at all like LSD or mushrooms, but instead a 'brain basher' or 'sense killer.' Do not take these if you are under a lot of stress or going through hard times. All and all it was an all right experience, but I personally would never do it again.
