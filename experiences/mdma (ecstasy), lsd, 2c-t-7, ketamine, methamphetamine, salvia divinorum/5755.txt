I will just start out by saying that ANYONE who likes psychedelics should try this sometime.--><BR>

My life changed forever in a good way after this night.<BR>
We had been planning the night for over a week with my friends. I invited some friends who I hadn't seen for a while so that it would be like old times. I was more ready for this night than any other night of drug use that I had before (which was MANY).  I had a very good mindset, wanting to be more fucked up than I ever had been before, and ready to love every minute of it.  But NOTHING had prepared me for this night.  <BR>
<BR>
We made sure that there would be nothing to worry about this night. We weren't near any parents (being in college now), not near any authority figures, and set up our room in a safe manner - to make sure no one would hurt themselves.<BR>
<BR>
We were all sitting in a large suite (has 5 people living in it), there is one main room, and a smaller room off to the side.  On all 4 corners of the room are beds.  We made sure to sit next to the window to ventilate ourselves and the room from all the smoke that would be produced during the span of the night.<BR>
<BR>
So, 12:00am rolled around, and I decided to pop 2 E pills (these were very large triple stacked orange pills called 'Pikachus.') By 12:15 I was feeling a slight sense of euphoria. At 12:30 my eyes started twitching and I was rolling my face off.  These particular pills made me roll harder than any pills I had ever eaten.  I honestly could not control my eye movement at all, traces everywhere also.  I had a clean roll until about 1:45am, when all of a sudden things started to get trippy.  Colors seemed brighter, but my mindset seemed to still have the 'happy' feeling of MDMA.  At 2:10am I ate 10 hits of strong blotter acid.  <BR>
<BR>
By 2:45am the acid started to take over the roll and my mind started thinking non-stop.  We all decided to move to our friend's room (down the hall of the floor) to smoke some salvia.<BR>
<BR>
2:50am - I took a a few large inhales of salvia (5X extract).  The time that followed those inhales (the next hour and a half) would be the single most fucked up that I have ever been in my entire life.  Right before I smoked the salvia, the acid visuals began to somewhat take hold, walls were melting, things were crawling around.<BR>
<BR>
After I exhaled the salvia, I heard what seemed to be a shotgun going off next to me.  All of a sudden I felt like I had fallen into a dream.  Nothing seemed to be real anymore.  I looked up at the ceiling (there were glow in the dark stars), and they started shooting downwards with rainbow trails following them. There was a picture on the wall with some buildings and a river, the buildings seemed to come alive and the river started flowing like a cartoon. I heard more gunshots.  At this point, I was more excited and happy than I ever have been.  I thought to myself 'this is how fucked up I have always wanted to be.'  <BR>
<BR>
3:05am - I decided to take a walk around the building.  I stepped outside of the dark room, and all of a sudden I was in a world with millions of cartoon fish floating in the air around me, along with stars and galaxies.  I reached out to touch them, when my hand hit them they disappeared, and then reappeared swimming through the air in another place.  My thoughts at this point became clearer than they EVER have been.  Everything in my life suddenly made sense to me.  All of the inner questions that I always asked myself were suddenly answered from a force within me.  I found everything that I was always looking for - myself within myself.  A quick note:  Before this moment in my life, I was one of the most depressed people that you have ever met.  I hated life and attempted to end my life previous times.  Once I smoked that salvia, the depression went away as my thoughts became clearer.  I found the real me.  I grew so much as a person for the next hour and a half (while the salvia lasted).  I am now one of the happiest and most content people that you will ever meet - crazy shit, huh?<BR>
<BR>
For that next hour and a half (until about 4:20am the salvia was kicking hard), I saw the most intense visuals that I had ever seen.  I was going to the bathroom, and as I looked at the toilet is suddenly turned into a huge dragon and breathed fire at me.  The walls were filled with skeletons and pirates dancing around.  The world of fish was also constant.<BR>
<BR>
4:30am - The salvia has worn off, and the candyflip is running strong.  I decide to eat some more acid at this point as well as smoking 2 blunts of kindbud.  I ate another 20 hits of liquid acid. We smoked the blunts and then just sat around talking about different ideas of life and reality, as well as the world as a whole and how people act.  It was incredibly enlightening.<BR>
<BR>
5:00am - The rest of the acid is starting to kick in. The acid visuals seem to take over the entire room, nothing seems even remotely close to reality.  I continue thinking about myself as a person and learned more about myself.  <BR>
<BR>
5:15am - I take my last E pill and crush it up into 4 big lines.  I snort the entire thing.  It hit me within seconds, the MDMA made me feel incredibly lovey and warm.  <BR>
<BR>
5:45am - I decide to snort some Ketamine.  I take 4 bumps of it. <BR>
<BR>
5:55am - The K is beginning to have its effects on me at this point. It intensifies the acid and E even more so than they have been, the visuals are deeper and more distorted now.<BR>
<BR>
6:15am - My friend breaks out the crystal meth.  I take 2 bumps of that, and suddenly the roll is intensified by about 100x.  I feel like I am rolling my face off again, but the acid remains strong as hell and the visuals also intensify more.<BR>
<BR>
6:30am - We decide to smoke 2 more blunts of kindbud.  The weed is really not having any effect on me anymore, all of the drugs in me seem to be a blur of chemicals, thoughts, and feelings now.  My body at this point feels like its rolling (no acid feeling), but the visuals are so intense that you wouldn't even think I was rolling.  My thought process is now no more about myself, but about my friends and how greatful I am for having them.  We talk deeply about life in general and relationships. <BR>
<BR>
6:45am - 2ct7.  I break open a pill (10mg dose) and snort it. I had never done 2ct7 before, so I wasn't sure what to expect, actually I wasn't really expecting to feel anything because I had done so much during the night.<BR>
<BR>
7:05am - WOW!!!!!  2ct7's visuals have blended with the LSD now. Things are still crawling, melting, and colors are changing, but now there seem to be 4 spectrums of color in my field of vision. Blue, green, red, and orange.  <BR>
<BR>
7:30am - I eat 5 more hits of liquid acid and smoke 3 bowls of kindbud.  At this point, the visuals are still the same as they were and the E was still kicking hard.<BR>
<BR>
8:00am - I still feel generally the same as I have for the past 2 or 3 hours.  We pack 2 more bowls of salvia.  I took 3 large inhales, and once again I fall into the dreamworld.  Although this time there were no visuals from it, just the intense thought process.  <BR>
<BR>
9:00am - The salvia is now wore off.  <BR>
<BR>
1:30pm - The visuals from the acid are still going stronger than ever.  At points it seems as if I am coming down, but then all of a sudden everything starts shifting, melting, colors change, ect. <BR>
 <BR>
4:00pm - I finally get to sleep, I pass out from exhaustion.<BR>
<BR>
8:00pm - I wake up, to find that I am still tripping face and still feel like I am rolling.  The visuals are not as intense anymore, but colors are still distored and things are still crawling, as well as the thought process being that of one on LSD.  <BR>
<BR>
12:00am - Effects finally wear off.<BR>
<BR>
24 STRAIGHT HOURS!!!!  <BR>
Final Note: This was the most intense experience that I have ever had.  I am a new person after this night.  All of life's answers are within you, just search hard enough!!
