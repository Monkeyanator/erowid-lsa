I was chillin in the hood one night when I suddenly became full of energy and adrenaline. I did not sleep for three nights. I started hallucinating and communicating telepathicaly with an unknown entities.<BR>
<BR>
After the fourth day I was taken to the hospital in an ambulance. In the hospital I could not communicate with anyone. I just lay there with stars passing me by in my brain. Like they used to show on Star Trek. I also thought I was an IBM Proprinter. <BR>
<BR>
They shot me full of Haldol. I almost choked to death due to the side effects of the Haldol. I crawled out of my bed into the hall and down the hall to the nurses station. They shot me up with benydryl, and I could breath again.<BR>

I have not been able to work full time for eight years due to the medication I have to take. It makes me exhausted. I have been on this bad trip for eight years.
