I've been trying to work out what Lotus does and why it was so important for ancient civilisations for about four months. The largest dose I did was 5 grams of 5 times extract in some tea. But having a dose that large wasn't worth it, the effects of a large dose aren't that much more intense than a moderate dose. When you smoke it it has a relaxing effect, and if you have it with alcohol the effects are much more intense. The ancient Egyptians used to put  it into wine, and the ancient Vedic Indians used to brew an alcoholic drink out of Lotus nectar itself. If all Lotus did was relax you why would it be so important in Egyptian & Indian art? It has the most prominent position in all ancient art where it is featured and I think that this is for a reason. <BR>

If you smoke some Lotus and then sit down and relax you will not experience the full effects. You have to do a few things to bring the effects on, kind of like with 2CB at a low dose. The first thing you should do after smoking Lotus is hold your hands together like you are preying, but leave a small gap between them. After a couple of seconds you will feel a very strong force start to build up between your hands. The force feels slightly different if you are on Blue Lotus to Pink Lotus, and if you have them together you can feel it even stronger. Let your hands charge up with energy for about a minute and the try holding them slightly above other parts of your body, or better, hold a hand over a friend's body. I shit you not, after smoking Lotus you can physically feel each others auras with your hands. It feels like you are holding two magnets together. After you've played around with this for a while you could try standing in a ring with your friends and all holding your hands up so they are nearly touching. It feels like there is an electric current flowing through you. <BR>

If you hold your two index fingers up in front of your face so the tips are about half an inch apart you can almost see the static charge between them. Lotus doesn't cause any visual distortions, but if you look into an empty space or shut your eyes you can see a very subtle but complex patern of energy flowing around. The easiest way to see it is to turn off the light or go outside at night, make a frame with your hands and look at the centre. The more you relax your eyes the better you can see it. I read somewhere a while ago that in ancient Egypt priests would take Lotus and go into an ecstatic trance. I thought this was weird when I first tried it because the effect seems to be pretty mild. But then something strange happened. I was going about my daily business having taken some Lotus the night before, and I got a piece of very good news. Yes! I exclaimed to myself, and as I realised how good the news was I got this intense feeling of energy in my head and my body felt all charged up with energy all of a sudden. It was pleasurable but not really like an ecstasy rush. For about half an hour after it happened I felt really, really good like I was on a small dose of ecstasy. <BR>

I think the Lotus must have made my brain capable of producing more serotonin, but only when I do actually have a reason to be happy. So if you take Lotus try concentrating on something that you are really pleased about and see if anything similar happens. I've found that you can still do the things you learn to do on Lotus with your body's energy for quite some time after you had the Lotus. I'm trying to learn how to meditate myself into an ecstatic trance when on Lotus, but it's not easy. However I do think it is possible, and I think that once you've done it you won't need to take Lotus to do it again. Lotus is a tool. If you smoke it and don't work with it then it won't give you that much. But if you play around with it then you can find out some really interesting things. Happy exploring!
