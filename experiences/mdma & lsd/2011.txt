For those who don't know, Candyflipping is combining the use of LSD and Ecstasy simultaneously. There are different ways to candyflip, as in which to take 1st and how far apart. Here are a couple of examples:<BR>

My friends and I just attended a really great rave here in the United States. The Midwest scene (outside of Chicago) has been blowing up like crazy. We scored our acid back home and all 3 of us planned on Candyflippin for the 1st time at the nights event. I also take Allegra for allergies, but i skipped my night dose just in case, it only works 12 hrs. Well, I was the driver and we had about an 75 minute drive to get to the venue. Our acid was fresh as could be, just dropped onto sugarcubes right before we left town. My friends each took one cube as we left home and then another cube as we got within 30 minutes of the venue. They were just starting to feel the LSD effects as we stood in line for the rave. I, on the other hand, was the driver so I took my acid as I got out of the car and headed to the line. I took 2 cubes together and then got in line. Within 30 minutes we scored some Ecstasy, which were Scorpions. My friends were already trippin pretty good and then even better when they started to rush and roll. Now let me recant. They took 1 cube acid, then half hour later took another cube, then 45 minutes later took the Roll. I took 2 cubes, then half hour later took my Roll. <BR>

If you think about the duration of onset and effects you can start to see the differences we would have in our 2 different styles of candyflippin'. They had a much more smooth experience and had a lot more speedy feel with heightened visuals, whereas I had the X and the acid both kick in at the same time. Oh my god, what visuals, what a feeling! I could hardly dance most of the night. Everything was hitting me all at once and I was flippin so hard from the two. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't a bad thing, I just couldn't get my groove goin on the dancefloor like usual. Most of the night I would just stand in the middle of the dancefloor with my hand against my chest under my chin, head rolled back, eyes rolled back, jaw dropped. just seeing some of the most amazing visuals from the huge lazer and light show. I was just plain GONE. My friends got to dance the night away, while i leaned up against the speakers just staring into space, lights flashing everywhere in a haze. One thing I would recommend is to start with just 1 does of acid if you plan on candyflippin', 2 may have been a bit much, and 3 is just damn crazy! If you wanna just get blown away, then do like I did and drop the cid 30 minutes before the X and then Rush and start to peak at the exact same time.<BR>

Other cool things we did or had done for fun:<BR>
<BR>
1.Have someone massage some Icy-Hot, Ben-Gay, or Tiger Balm all over your back or neck while you are rollin. Oh my! <BR>
2.Rub some Oral-Gel all over your teeth, lips, and gums while rollin. Weird! <BR>
3.Eat some Pop-Rocks or other fizzing candy while you roll. Great feel!<BR>
4.Take one of those large gummy spiders or scorpians and just let it sit in your mouth with the legs hanging out over your lips. Creepy!
