My friend and I had made our way over to a record shop to see a few local bands and stumbled upon a friend whom offered to sell us some weed. Being quite glad we ran into him we purchased a 15 sac and made our way over to the concert. <BR>
<BR>
After arriving there and staying for about an hour we decided to go smoke up with a few friends whom we conveniently ran into. We arrived at his garage and had a beer. Than he pulled out a bowl and a half ounce and started passing it around.  We left after what seemed like 30 minutes. <BR>
<BR>
We arrived at my friends house and smoked some of our 15 sac. Then found ourselves in his brothers bedroom listening to Ministry. I was wearing my SFX contact lenses which made my eyes red and yellow. I started mouthing the words to the song and air guitaring to it. My friend started cracking up and saying my eyes looked like they were on fire. He said he thought I was Satan and started geeking out a little bit, so  I decided to stop. Than started poking at his eyes but not really touching them. He grabbed his eyes and started moaning like I had really poked him. He said it felt like his pupils were going into the back of his head and down into his throat. I started cracking up but at the same time a sense of fear had come over me. So I tried to take control and decided that we go downstairs and eat something. We walked into the kitchen and he puked into the sink and repeated trying to puke when there was nothing left.<BR>
<BR>
I was trying to control my laughter considering the fact that I was scared out of my mind. Yet I still managed to try to calm him down and myself as well. By now I realized we had to be tripping some sort of way. We had gone back to his brothers room and started watching TV. He had gone to bed because his head was spinning and he couldn't take it. I was overcome with fear of my friend getting this weird idea in his head and coming into the room and murdering me, so I locked the door. Than I heard a voice in the back of my head telling me to go do what I just thought. I was staring at a sharpened pencil laying on the ground than geeked out and threw the covers over my head. I squeezed my eyes shut in hopes to fall asleep.<BR>
<BR>
I woke up a few minutes later to find myself in the same state. I went downstairs to get something to eat. Somehow I managed to cook eggs and wrap them up in a burrito with cheese. I sat down to eat it and kept on seeing someone in the doorway out of the corner of my eye. I just ignored it. After taking a few bites the burrito started to taste real bad. I looked at it and the eggs were all liquidy and looked like some sort of mush. I spit it out on the plate and threw it away. Than ran up stairs into the same room, locked the door, and forced myself asleep.
