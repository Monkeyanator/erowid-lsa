I got a 20 bag from this guy I didn't know.  The next day my friend and I, who have been smoking pot for years, decided to get high.  I didn't have a lot of pot left, so I made a gravity bong and I gravitied a bowl the size of the end of my pinkie, and he did about the same, a little less.  It turns out about 15 minuts later we walked up to the store, and I felt way different.  It wasn't like a weed high, it was way more intense.  I felt so high.  We sat down and my mind felt like I was totally disconnected from reality.  Everything was so bright and fake.  I went inside to get away from everyone and I sat down.  I heard someone whistling and it was like my hearing was superhuman.  I just concentrated on this guy whistling.  Every sound echoed in my ear and stood out.  I laid my head down and closed my eyes.  I could see these patterns moving in my head.  I went to the bathroom and my eyes were dilated and I kept hearing these strange echoes.  I tapped my foot on the ground and it felt like I was connected with the ground.  <BR>

For the next 3 hours I was going up and peaking.  I was getting higher and higher.  I heard thunder that wasn't there, I thought people were following me.  The only thing comforting to me was to be by myself.  I heard voices that weren't there, it sounded like they were mumbling.  I went home and went to bed at 10:00, 5 hours after smoking it, I was still high, but not like before.  I woke up the next morning and felt weird, like something was still in me.  Also, I woke up at 8am and had massive energy.  I heard a knock at the door and it was my friend, but when I first saw him I said whoa shit, cause he looked all weird and his face was small.  I am convinced the weed was laced with pcp and my advice is, if you think it is, just get away from everybody and be alone with nature and you'll be fine.
