I have had the same experience as <A HREF='http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php3?ID=2903'>Jon</A> when he wrote 'Bad Trip'.  I used to be a heavy user until got caught.  I am 15 and recently had started using zoloft for anxiety and it seemed to work but at the same time I also started using bud heavily.  Alomost everyday after school for about two weeks.  Everyday I would smoke about 5 bowls with a freind.  But now it feels like im still in a mild high.  Like a phsycosis.  its really hard to explain how I feel.  I see things diffeently and I think differently but I know whats going on.  It feels like I'm out of reality yet I know where I am and I know whats going on.  I dont know if its a combination of puberty, cannabis, and zoloft but it is really starting to scare me because I know that other people have the same problem.  But I like it because im not as anxious as I used to be.  I still act normal and I asked my family if they have noticed a change in me in the past 2 months or so and they said they havent.  <BR>

I havent smoked for about a month now and im still feeling it.  Sometimes I feel I am in a state on confusion but it quickly goes away and it sometimes feels im coming down from a high but comes back later.  I want my normal life back.  Also I have noticed that I do tasks without complaining.  For example, if my parents ask me to do something I used to complain and linger about the fact that I have to do this or I could be doing something else and would even look for ways to get out of it.  Now I just do it with no complaints.  But I think that is the zoloft working.  Its really hard to tell.
