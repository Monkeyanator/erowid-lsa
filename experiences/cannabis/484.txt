Upon arrival in Canada from Scotland, I was soon invited to try some lovely B.C weed going by the name of White Widow. The stuff was covered in sticky, white THC chrystals and was like nothing I had ever seen before. Having only smoked low-stength resin back home, I was well up for it as were my buddies. The smell was very pungent but very nice. <BR>

As soon as we lit up, we could feel the good times roll. After a few strong puffs, we were all absolutely f**ked. My English friend thought he was an explorer and started to swim accross the front lawn. Needless to say, the hilarity sent us into huge fits of uncontrollable laughter. Then, when it eventually subsided a little, I honestly started to believe I was a monkey. I sped around the room like monkeys do making the kind of noises monkeys do. We thought it was hilarious although one of my friends wasn't quite so impressed when I ate all the bananas out his cupboard but hey, I had the serious munchies.<BR>

After we all calmed down, we got down to some serious munching accompanied by some quality music. The visuals and sonics were amazing. Trip Hop was invented for this drug.<BR>

I don't know if we were smoking extra strong stuff or it was just because we were new to strong weed but this has to be the single best drug experience if my life.
