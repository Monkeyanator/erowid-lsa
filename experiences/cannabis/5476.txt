This report isn't about what happens to me when I smoke weed.  But here is an almost foolproof way to smoke places where you can't risk having other people smell your activities. I'm sure a lot of you already know it, but hey, those of you who don't ought to benefit from the knowledge.<BR>

First get a water bottle, like the type you can buy in a store for a buck. Then cut it in half, removing the bottom half. Take a couple of those dryer sheets (Bounce or something similar) and stuff them inside the tube. Voila! Now when you exhale your smoke put your mouth on the neck of the bottle, blow through it and the sheets absorb the smoke and emit a pleasant smell in its place (not that I don't think weed smells pleasant, but it certainly can get you in trouble). <BR>

Obviously you still need to towel your door crack, use a little fresh scent in the room and turn off the air conditioning, but the blow tube makes the smell almost a non-issue. Still, don't take chances.
