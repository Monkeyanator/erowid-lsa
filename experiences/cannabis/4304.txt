One day after work my friend and I decided to smoke some new kind bud that he just picked up a few days before. He told me that this stuff was strong, but being an experienced smoker I thought nothing of it.  We got to his house and his wife decided to toke with us. So I had a seat on the couch and he started to roll a nice jay. After rolling it, we proceeded to smoke this bad boy, of course passing it in session between the three of us. By the time the jay was gone I could not believe the quality of the bud, my head was seriously spinning.<BR>

This was different to me, most of the time I gotta smoke at least three jays to get where I was. He broke out his pipe, which didn't suprise me any, as I figured we were going to smoke more. He packed about 20 roaches in the pipe and me and him smoked them, and then he packed 2 bowls of the kind bud. Needless to say, I was baked, standing up not possible. We started to watch tv and got tired of it quickly. We ended up going and playing pool at a local bar, I could hardly make a shot much less order drinks. I ended up messing up the drink order and we all had soda. So we went over to my friend's house and sat there and played video games.<BR>

The buzz had begun at 11:00 am and we left the bar at about 12:45, and the rest of the time we played video games. I ended up looking at some of my friend's art that he had on the wall, and someone came over and started to talk to me. I asked them what time it was because I had to be somewhere at 4:00. They said it was 10:30. I said, 'What the hell, it's not 10:30, quit messing with me.' But it actually was 10:30 and I ened up missing some important dates, but oh well, I was too baked to care. We had been smoking while playing the games, about 4 more bowls.<BR>

Well, I guess I would have to say never underestimate the true power of good bud and always keep an eye on what time it is in case you need to be somewhere. I was almost in a time warp when I was looking at his artwork and the only reason I asked what time it was was because it felt like only 20-30 min.
