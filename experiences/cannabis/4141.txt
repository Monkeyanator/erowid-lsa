First and foremost, to those of you who don't know what a parachute is, it's a bottle and the bottom portion is cut off, then a bag is attached to the top of the bottle, and a bowl is made. The smoke is then sucked into the chute via pulling the bag down. These get you really chewed.<BR>
<BR>
Anyway, this was probably my 10th time or so smokin' weed. Now I consider myself a fairly veteran smoker, maybe even chronic. Pretty much every day. <BR>
<BR>
Myself, my friends, who we'll call Fatty and Satan, were sitting in Pug's basement, parachute in hand and about 2 grams of bud. We packed the first bowl and we each got about 2 chutes. By this time I couldn't really feel anything. After a few more bowls, I started feeling really dizzy and everything started to seem surreal. We continued to pack bowls, and by my 8th I wanted out of the rotation. But Satan loaded up another chute and gave it to me saying, 'here man, finish the rest.' As much as I didn't want to, I took it anyway. I tried to light the bowl but the lighter didn't seem to want to go anywhere near the bowl, so Satan lit it for me. After the next 4 chutes, I couldn't even sit on a chair without falling over. Everyone got up and started to run upstairs to get food. I started to follow and realized I was having a hell of a time getting up the stairs. I kept yelling, 'wait for me, wait! Everything is like a dream, this isn't really happening!' and the only recurring thought I had was one of being in the movie Peter Pan.<BR>
<BR>
Once upstairs, I was having a lot of trouble walking. I spotted a bag of chips and dug in, falling onto the couch. As I scarfed down the chips, I realized that I had forgotten how to swallow. I stared in disbelief at my two friends, and they just laughed at me. I thought I was going to die. I managed to down a 2 litre bottle of Pepsi in a minute, and the chips went down. I had a lot of trouble grasping what was real and what was not.<BR>
<BR>
I didn't say a word for what seemed like hours, but when I decided to say something, I forgot how to talk, my lips could move and I could mouth the words, but all that came out was a scratching noise. I was scared. I felt like I was going to be in this state of mind forever, and would never be the same. I kept telling myself, over and over, 'I'm never doing this again, drugs aren't the thing for me, I don't ever want to get high again.'<BR>
<BR>
About an hour and a half later I felt my brain returning to its original state. I was never more relieved. <BR>
<BR>
That was probably one of the scariest things I've ever been through, if not the scariest. But, as you probably guessed, I went out and got high the very next day.<BR>
<BR>
This just goes to show, don't start off crazy, work your way up dosages. Now I can outsmoke a lot of people, and have smoked half ounces in one night with one other person. Understand the drug, and have a vague idea of what to expect. And NEVER try to fight the high, it just makes things worse.
