I had never been so stoned in all my life. Of course, I had never really been stoned. I had been high more than a handful of times, mostly just contact highs but also a couple of times smoking up. Nothing, not even the experiences of my friends, could have prepared me for what happened though. It was crazy.<BR>
<BR>
The week before this happened, I had all four of my wisdom teeth removed. I had been on painkillers for a couple of days, but stopped taking them a few days before the 'main event'. My parents were going away for the weekend, so I figured I'd have a house party, just me and some friends, and it ended up lasting a few days. Apparently I have a great backyard for smoking - nobody can see into my back yard unless they are standing in it, which is a plus.<BR>
<BR>
Friday night before my parents left, two of my friends came over and smoked a little, and we ended up laughing on the basement floor for a good half hour, why I don't know. But the next day was even better. Saturday night, what a night it was. Me and three guys smoking in my backyard. Something none of us thought we would be doing - nobody thought they'd ever be stoned at my house, hell, nobody thought they'd ever see me stoned! Good girl gone bad, I guess.<BR>
<BR>
We smoked so much I think I blacked out on my patio at one point. I remember someone waking me up and we went inside, to watch TV or something. That first time I really felt what it was like being stoned, I didn't say too much. I don't remember much of that particular night. I do remember solving the Rubik's cube. I can solve it sober in about 3 minutes, but I tried it stoned - it was the only thing I could focus on for whatever amount of time it took me to solve it. But it kept me in touch with reality, when everything else was wavy and jumpy and slow all at the same time. The volume of sounds kept changing and the only way I could keep it normal was if people kept talking at a constant rate. Strange.<BR>
<BR>
I was having premonitions, jumping time, I don't really know how to describe it other than I saw something happen (pillow hitting a can of soda and spilling it onto the floor) before it happened. This wasn't the first vision, I had seen flashes of a man in a white tee-shirt in the woods on Friday night (before this party), that scared the bejesus outta me. Next thing I know, it's morning, and I'm still out of it. But feeling the need, the need for weed. Yes. So one of my friends (who had brought his stash for us to use) packed a bowl and we went back outside to smoke some more. That hit me fast, but not as badly as the night before, and it was a lot more fun. I definitely said a lot more this time. Even later that day I invited some more friends over and we smoked up some more.<BR>
<BR>
It thundered that day. I kept yelling that the thunder was trying to get into my house to steal my pop tarts. I had a discussion with my friend about the difference between real soda and 'mind soda'. The whole time I had this incredibly distorted sense of touch. I was asking people if I was moving my hand because I couldn't feel it moving (though apparently it was moving). I knocked soda cans over and walked into a table and didn't even feel it. This feeling didn't wear off for days.<BR>
<BR>
Wednesday, parents are back, I'm paranoid that the house smells like weed but nobody notices it except for me so I'm playing it cool. I cleaned up the mess from the party (over 30 soda cans, and the remnants of three days of the munchies) before they returned. But the feeling is still lingering with me. I feel fizzly. You know those fireworks that make the fizzling, sssssssssss, frying pan noise? That's what I feel like. If someone touches my arm with one finger, I feel it all through my arm, sort of like pins and needles only not as painful and a lot longer lasting. I scratch my face and then put my arm back down and I'm not sure if I ever really scratched my face. It's cool but at the same time freaky.<BR>
<BR>
If I've learned anything from this, it's got to be don't smoke too much at one time. It's not as fun if you black out. And keep more food in the house. Munchies are bad if you have no food to eat (I think I bit someone because I was hungry). Some people say life is just a bowl of cherries - we say life is just a cherried bowl. Can't wait for my parents to go out of town again.
