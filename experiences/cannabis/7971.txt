One time, I was sitting at the computer, and I had just smoked a fat joint.  My heart started beating so hard, like it was going to explode.  I was very scared, and got up from the computer.  The ringing in my ears was so loud I could hear the blood rushing through my veins. <BR>

A lot of people, including a few doctors, advised me that  they were probably panic attacks.  When I knew that, the next time I felt one coming on I acknowledged that I was panicking, and calmed myself down by going with the feelings and not trying to encourage them or stop them.  It worked very well because I knew what was happening, and that I wasn't dying.  The fear was gone because the experience was not unknown anymore.<BR>

It is important to realize that these types of experiences are probably an indicator of how an out-of-control behaviour of ours is affecting our life.  In my case, I was smoking more weed than I could handle.  I should take a break, and resume it when I feel ready, and maybe not as frequent as before.
