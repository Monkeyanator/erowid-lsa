STRANGE RUMOR?<BR>
<BR>
A few weeks ago, my chronic supplier, whome I had learned to trust exclusively for my pot dealings, showed me some new stuff he had just aquired and told me 'It tastes like shit but it'll still fuck you up.' I thought that was kind of odd so I grabbed the nearest bong and proceeded to try and smoke some of this odd looking bud. It looked as if the plant that the buds were grown on had died and the buds started to die out before they were picked. It was slightly  brownish and had a stench to it that reminded me of gasoline. I put my reservations aside and took a few large bong rips... Within a few seconds after gagging on the foulest tasting bud I've ever had I noticed that this stuff couldn't have been regular bud. I was very fucked up and could barely think straight. I know what your thinking 'Isn't that what it's supposed to do?' Well yes that is true but i was so disoriented I could barely move. I thought that the bud was smuggled in someones gas tank and it got soaked or something, but then a couple of days later I ran into this guy who was telling me about how some guys were growing bud and they injected the mature plants with Ketamine (special K, K-Jay,etc.). This acts as a defoliate and kills the plant within a few days. The buds that are reaped from this plant will still have traces of the Ketamine in the buds and can be passed on to you through though smoking it. <BR>
     The moral of the story : If the bud smells like petroleum, beware! You just might end up tripping on K and not even know it... well now you will. Wether that is a good or a bad thing is a matter of personal preference.<BR>
