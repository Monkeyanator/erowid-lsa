I started smoking a couple of months ago and have since become a more laid-back person who feels more at peace with her life and the world.  Marijuana is so commonplace and such a part of my life now that I hardly think of it as a drug, yet I have had a couple of experiences that were definitely mindblowing and reminded me that weed is more than food.  I had heard people speak of seeing sounds and feeling colors, etc. when they were tripping off acid, etc. but I never believed that such effects could be triggered by marijuana.<BR>

However, not too long ago, me and a couple of friends packed a bowl with some really potent KB and after about three hits I was really tripping hard.  I was sitting in a car in a parking lot at night listening to trance music.  My eyelids were drooping and I could not move my body at all, not that I wanted to.  The music was enthralling--I could actually see it.  Everyone knows that smoking makes music better and I definitely appreciate it more when I am high, but seeing music is something else.  It was as if each facet of the music, and there were probably at least twenty--the bassline, the main melody, that strange clicking noise in the background, etc.--every noise took on a visual shape.  I could see every line of the music moving and dancing to its beat.  It was beautiful, absolutely breathtaking, until one of the shapes--a pink ball of light--began circling my head repeatedly.<BR>

First I was dizzy, then I became nauseous and my friend laughed as she changed the song because I was groaning that the music was making me sick.  Who would have thought you could see music and feel its effects?  Ever since this experience I have better recognized the beauty of music when you are high, though never again have I actually seen the sounds.  Marijuana enhances all the senses though, and on other occasions I have felt lights.  Driving down the highway at night, the streetlamps seemed to stroke my body and the feeling was intense.  In conclusion, marijuana is a wonderful substance that can open your body and mind to otherworldly experiences.
