I'd always heard that eating Cannabis produced an entirely different effect than smoking it, so I went about experimenting on my own.  I cooked about 7 small/medium buds in 7 Tbsps of butter, by microwaving it to hot, but not boiling, then letting it cool for 15 minutes, then repeating the process for about 2 hours.  When I was done, it was a crystallized, almost icy mix, still kind of wet.  I ate the entire thing on toast with jelly.  The taste is a little strong by itself, so the jelly was a must.  I didn't strain anything out, just ate everything.<BR>

About 30 minutes later, I was well on the way to a trip that I can only compare to about 50%-75% of an acid trip.  It kept getting more and more severe, complete with tracers, an inability to speak, an inability to stand up or even concentrate on anything.  Wasn't a very cognitive high, more of just an experience kind of high.  VERY unsimilar to smoking it.  After the experience, I don't think I'll ever smoke it again, I'll only eat it.  I was never a huge fan of the smoking side-effects anyway.
