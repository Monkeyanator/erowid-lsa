One day me and two of my friends went into a nature center to smoke this new weed that one of the friends just got. This was the best stuff I had ever smoked! After only three hits, I went insane. At first I started laughing uncontrollably, which always happens. Then as we were walking through the paths, my vision started to blink vertically instead of the normal horizontal (when blinking). All the colors everywhere became very amazing and bright, but that was nothing. Now about five minutes have passed with straight laughter, and then I noticed that it sounded as if all sound was coming directly to my ears, and not traveling through the air. this was an amazing sensation to me. <BR>

After we all piled into the van, we drove off to find a place to skate.  While we were at a red light, I went into a trip where I thought i was talking out my window to a ticketman in his ticket booth. While talking to him about who knows what, I remember holding onto a pet alligator and petting it. Then right before the light turned green, I woke up to find that my pet alligator had dissapeared! I yelled out to my friends,'where did my pet alligator go?!' as if they knew. Then I explained to them what had just happened while we were at the red light. They just laughed at me and we drove on. <BR>

Then they stoped at a Hardees to get something to eat. They decided to keep me in the van because it wouldn't be a good idea to bring me inside, because I was still laughing non-stop. While they were inside, I imagined a rabbid bunny jumping out from behind a bush and attacking an ant. They came back to the van to find me still laughing it up. I told them the story, but they couldn't understand because I was mumbling and laughing way too much.<BR>

We found a good place to skate, but I was too tired to get out of the van. so my friends had to drag me out and set me on the grass. They skated for a while, while I just sat there watching them and laughing about the crazy noises I was hearing. Then a security guard came along and shoed us away. I was careful enough to keep it straight, but it was extemely hard. After that we just drove home and wait a bit till I came down, so then I could tell them my whole story and they could tell me what they thought about it.
