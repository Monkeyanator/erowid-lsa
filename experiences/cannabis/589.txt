This is about the first time I was REALLY stoned. The first few times I smoked, I didn't feel much but maybe a little giddy. Since this experience, I have gotten stoned many times, but never quite like this.<BR>
<BR>
I was at a friend's house, and we were just talking and having a good time. I suggested we get some weed, so I sprung for a dimebag. The room was lit only with a blacklight and the glow of the TV. I smoked a lot, I would guess about seven hits. I got up off the couch and I felt like I was swimming. I could barely walk. After that, things get hazy, but I left the apartment and went down to mine.<BR>
<BR>
I laid down on my bed and put on my headphones and 'Tomorrow Never Knows' by the Beatles. I was instantly tranported into another world. It vaguely felt like India, but like a desert with strange people with weird clothes walking around in the sand. I closed my eyes and let the music talk to me. I could see the face of John Lennon, and he seemed to be telling me what to do. I heard (or felt) a voice say, 'Music is the language of the universe'. I was thrown into deep, reflecting thought. The line of the song, 'Listen to the color of your dreams' had a similer effect.<BR>
<BR>
The song was sort of fast, so everything in my 'mind-movie' was, like, sped up. Things moved very fast. I  got the feeling that I had entered a new world. I could 'see' the music, and be inside the mind of the artists. I felt like I was taking a leap of faith off a cliff, yet overwhelming peace. Overall, it was a 'it's OK' feeling, like no matter what happens, It's gonna turn out fine.<BR>

It felt as if a veil was lifted off my mind, and I could see the universe as a whole, and see beauty in everything. I knew that the universe is one, bound together by music and love. I knew that I would always see the world from a slightly different perspective, perhaps a higher one. Since then I have seen order in chaos, and chaos in order. As a musician, I have changed dramatically. Overall, I feel a hightened awareness, and a greater connection with the universe, the earth, and mankind.
