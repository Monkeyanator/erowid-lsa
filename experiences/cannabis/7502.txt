They say pot isn't addictive... And it's not, PHYSICALLY addictive, but I am definetly mentally addicted.  It's kinda odd actually, because alot of times I don't really want to get high, but I still find myself reaching for a bowl.  The craziest thing I've ever done in search of weed is crawl around on the floor looking for buds I might have dropped while packing a bowl the night before.  I get odd, INTENSE cravings out of the blue.  I get high at the most inappropriate times, and I don't even know why...  I also go well over recommended doses.  For instance, if I come across some so-called 'one-hit shit',  I'll smoke it all, and get totally wasted.  Like once I got a gram of some really nice orange hair shit... COVERED in crystals.  It was all gone withing an hour!  I've found myself barely able to move, still hitting up a bowl.  It's like there is no such thing as 'too stoned' in my mind.  <BR>

But I'd like to end this submission on a positive note...I love weed!  It's great,  I've expanded my mind ALOT.  I've dropped all of my previous predjudices, and find myself a better person than before I started smoking... Often scrounging for money to give to a poor homeless guy on a street corner, when I used to just laugh and say that he needs to go find a job.  Or 'Yeah right, look at those tennis shoes.  He's a llllliiiiiiaaaarrrrr'.  So even if pot is psychologicly addictive,  what better thing to get addictive to?
