I've been smoking weed since I was 11, no weird side affects, just gettin high and having a good time. Well, beginning of 2001, I started getting high like, 5-6 times a day, at school, around town. Spending money everyday for marijuana was putting me in great debt, considering Im irresponsible ( dont have a job, wont babysit, etc..). Then I started trying out other drugs, cocaine, speed, maybe they had part in my incredibly strange experiences. The totally weird situations have occurred just 3 times, while high that is. <BR>
<BR>
The first time it happened, was at school. A couple guy friends and I bought a gram, a real nice gram, and it was some primo shit. We went back behind the pizza place by our high school, and lit up....between the 3 of us, a gram seemed to get us pretty stoned. We went back into the School, and down into the Cafeteria. I sat at a table, a couple friends and I, and they got their laughs at me while I sat there, completely stoned, looking like a totaly idiot. I got the munchies of course, and since there is a SUBWAY ( submarine sandwich restaurant) in our school cafeteria, I thought Id go buy some of their amazingly good, chewy M&M cookies to feed my hunger. It was $2 (canadian) for 6 cookies, I had a loonie ( a dollar ) in one hand, and a twoonie ( 2 dollars ) in the other. She asked for $2, I put out my 2 hands infront of myself, and examined the coins. WHICH ONE WAS $2?? I had no clue, I stood there, confused and clueless as to how I should pay...she reached out with an astounded look on her face, took the twoonie and sent me on my way. I sat at the table, and stared at my friend sitting across from me ( we'll refer to her as Stacy ). I opened up my bag of cookies, and felt my head begin to fall onto the table. Everything surrounding me wasnt real, I was not ACTUALLY there and this was just an intense dream...or was it?! I dumped the cookies onto the table, and broke them, over and over, into 100 000 000 pieces, and then put them back in the bag. Thoughts were rushing through my head, and suddenly I felt my body take a new form. I was indeed, a pillow. Not just your standard rectangular fluff stuffed pillow, I was in the shape of  'B'....This being a new sensation for me, was quite frightening. I burst into tears, not realizing what motions I was making I grabbed onto my friends hands tightly and wouldnt let go. I squinched my eyes shut tight, grinded my teeth together, almost as if I was in agonizing pain like having a baby...I screamed at the top of my lungs, tears streamed down my face, endlessly. I had a panic attack, I was trying to tell my worried friends what I felt and what I was going through...but what came out was my shrieks of suffering, and muttered words no one could understand. They laughed at my being so high, but it was so scary. Then I remembered, I remembered the time that jerk used me for sex and I blurted out, claer as day ' HE USED ME, HE JUST FUCKED ME '....everyone in the Cafeteria heard me, everyone saw me cry, everyone saw me scream. They knew I was stoned, how could they not? I continued to feel like a letter, the letter B...the feeling would came and then fade and then come and then fade, everything around me was watercolor, like a watercolor picture. I could hear my friends laughter, I could feel the cookie crumbs all over my hands and all over me. Then I stopped. I just stopped and sat, and then I laughed HYSTERICALLY for what seemed like hours on end. After all that fear I faced and embarrassment I went through, I wanted that feeling again.<BR>

After many more encounters with drugs, the second time comes along. Again at school ( the perfect place to chill out when stoned ), we decide classes are just too boring, so we find some drugs, and go get high. We decide not to hang out in the school, no one is skipping this period today, we are pretty much the only ones. Walking infront of the school, the 3 of us begin to feel it. Our legs numb, we all giggle a bit. It was a nice, subtle high. The elementary school teachers in our area were on strike at this time, and since the main offices for the school board were in our high school, they decided to protest there. They had donuts, and pop, and even a big barrel, with a fire in it! Fascinated in our little world of drug invaded minds, we make a plan. At the time it seemed like the greatest plan of all time, but really, it wasnt, not the slightest bit. We decided to tell the striking elementary teachers that the chocolate donuts were defective, and that they had to give them to us ( we were hungry! ). We neared them, but as soon as we got to their large grouping, the 3 of us froze, standing still with confusion. Who was going to tell them?! We looked at each other, laughed and went into the school. From the very large upper level window we watched the teachers, circling their fire with their protest posters held high. Again things began to fade away in my mind. Everything was not real, we were cartoons. Crayon markings gave my world its color, I felt like perhaps, again, I was dreaming. One of my friends ( we will refer to her as Erin ) began to see what I was seeing, cartoons!!She felt fake, and saw me and the third person ( brock ) as cartoons, or just, imaginary people. She started bobbing, up and down. Standing at the window she started muttering words, like I had just a few weeks before. She laughed though, she didnt shed a tear. It made me remember my fears, I screamed at her ' stop, stop, just stop '! Brock was terrified, students came out of their classrooms to see what the commotion was. I was hallucinating once again, no one was real. Everything was watercolor, the people were there, but they would fade away and come back, and fade away and come back....I told them all, I screamed at everyone to just get away from me. People of course knew of my reputation, PUNK/STONER. They knew I was high again, everyone had heard about my past Cafeteria incident, so they just left me, and my 2 friends to stare out the window. I couldnt take it anymore, the feeling just wasnt going away, I felt my body taking a new form again, I could feel my legs and my arms, twisting together and bending around. I was a pillow, this time, in the shape of the letter 'L'. I was blue in color, a light, baby blue. I didnt cry, I stood, panicking, looking into the confused faces of my 2 friends who in return laughed in my face. I told them it was happening again, before I got carried away I had to let them know what was about to happen, AGAIN. I started to whine, ' you guys, its happening,aaa, aaa, again, we have to go, we have to leave, aaa, oh my god! ' I ran, not knowing where I was headed, not even really knowing where I was. I ended up at my locker. I opened it, the period was over, it was break time and my fellow students would be filling the hallways soon. I opened my locker, put my head inside and shut the door on it. I kept my head in there, the whole 5 minute break until no one was left in the halls, just my 2 confused friends, and a few others who wanted to know what the fuck I was doing! I knew they were there, I didnt even have to look, I kept my head there, and I cried, and screamed and panicked. I didnt want anyone to know, although of course, they did. I came out of my locker, and walked down the hall, I had to piss so terribly bad. I walked down the hall, the high seemed to be fading away, everything was coming back to real time. I got to the bathroom doors and it hit me again. I panicked, leaned up against the wall and swung my arms at anything I saw that was moving. People far down the halls seeemed so close, Id swing my arms and kick my legs, push myself up against the wall and try and escape their grasp, when really, they were so far away. I sat on the floor against the wall, friends surrounding me, in dis-belief. How can someone get so messed on marijuana?! I didnt even smoke that much, a joint, not even a cannon, almost a pinner!! Nothing I couldnt handle, Id smoked much more before. That was all for that day.<BR>

The third and more than likely NOT final time this happened, was the worst. This time we got stoned after school. I went into my friends locker and took her wallet, stole $10, for a nice 10 chunk to get me and again, 2 friends high. It was a really nice 10 chunk,  the dealer ( refered to as Jimmy ) gave us more than we paid for, hes a nice guy, with some one hit shit! We went back into a park behind the school and I pulled out my one hitter. Hit, after hit, after hit, I smoked pretty much the whole thing to myself. I felt the high right away, I was so stoned. Like always it was just an awesome high and I was just having a great time. I had some difficulty walking over the slippery, icy snow ( more than I should have had ), but other than that it was just chinked eyes and a great mood! We cut across the football feild, and into the school ( which was out at the time ). We went to the Caf, and got a pop. I didnt feel anything scary coming on, so we just walked the halls of the school. Out of the blue, I stopped walking. I tried to move my legs but they just stiffened out. I leaned against some lockers and closed my eyes. I felt the urge to cry coming on, I had nothing to cry about but it always just takes control over me! The feeling quickly went away, and I walked outside. I figured I needed fresh air, but I soon discovered that it made things worse. We stood outside, infront of the school entrance. Everything was white with snow, the wind was blowing harshly into my face, so my eyes naturally filled with water, to protect them I suppose. I felt like I was stranded, like I had no where to run, no where to hide. I didnt know what I was scared of but I was terrified, and so I started to cry to my friends, asking them to help me. I felt my face quinch, and my throat choke. I was crying, again. Cars drove by, they all seemed to be shit brown cars and they stood out from everything else because everything else was white. I closed my eyes, and I dont know how long I stood there with my eyes closed, but when I finally opened them again, my friends werent there. I didnt know what to do, so I decided to walk home. I was walking, ofcourse ideas were just flowing through my head, things to say, do, things I wanted to touch. I looked ahead and there was a man on a bike ( bike, winter? ). He pedaled up the hill, and I watched him go. I blinked, and then he was gone. I saw a young man standing at the edge of the street beside a car instead, a different man. I came closer and closer, he just stood there. I started to think ' oh man, hes really there, im getting closer!! '....every time I blinked and then re-opene my eyes he seemed so much closer to me, and then I thought ' Well when I walk by him, Ill say something dumb, just to be an idiot ' When I finally reached him I closed my eyes, a voice inside me was telling me not to do it, it was just the drugs and not to say anything to him, he would think I was an idiot, for sure! I closed my eyes tight, and when I figured I was passed him I opened them. I saw a banana peel on the ground, but kept walking, then I realized that I really saw a banana peel so I turned around to make sure it was really there, and it was, and so was the guy I had walked passed. I really saw them!! I laughed to myself, and then thought to myself ' damn, Im so fucking stoned! ' laughed again to myself. Then I felt this weird feeling, like there were people around me ,watching me, thinking about how messed up I was. I started to cry, and I sat down on the sidewalk alone, to think. I felt unreal, I felt again like I was in a watercolor painting. Where had my friends gone, why was everyone leaving me? I cried and cried, until a man walked by me. He didnt ask what I was doing, why I was sitting there crying, he just walked by. He was wearing all red, a red hat, red pants, red coat.Maybe I really wasnt real, I thought that maybe he had walked right through me! I got up, and wiped the frozen tears from my face. I walked, following the red man. Blinked, and he was a woman! A woman santa claus!! I was surprised I mean, santa is a woman?! I ran ahead to get a better look, holy shit, it was santa! Like, who knew santa was a chick. I blinked, she disappeared. Then there was a woman, standing infront of her front door of her house, holding a coffee cup, dressed in work clothes and getting her mail from her mailbox. I saw her, and I knew she was there but the other part of me kept saying she wasnt, and that I should ask her if she was. So I walked and walked, watching her. She seemed to stand there forever, until I finally reached her front lawn. I called out to her ' Hey, Bitch, are you really there '? Too bad for me, she was, and she flipped out. I laughed, and then kinda ran I guess. I stood on the corner, laughing, almost pissing myself....then I got up, walked home and I ate like, 2 bowls of cereal and a hot dog, and like, I think I had chips too..I had the worst munchies ever, because I think that was the most stoned I have ever been. I still feel that intense smile across my face, making my cheek muscles ache. <BR>

Since these 3 things have happened to me, I have the occasional spontaneous panic attack. Without being high, I feel high, and I panic and cry, and whine, and then laugh. Just like Im high. Im thinking maybe there were some premanent effects, what do you think?! Weed is the best, smoke pot for life!YEAH!
