It was around 1030 pm and I was bored looking for something to do. I called my friend who lived a few miles away from where I was to see if he wanted to hang out. I was 16 and was with my friend driving around looking for something to do. I called his cell and left a message saying if he wanted to chill that he should call me back. <BR>
<BR>
It was a pretty dull night as of then, I went to my best friends house to find he was with his girlfriend and wanted nothing to do with me at the time. Boy did he miss out.<BR>
<BR>
Around 1145 I got a call from my friend saying that it was all right to come over and that we could chill for a while. When I got there the moon was gleaming over the lake over looking his house and I thought what a perfect night this was going to be. <BR>
<BR>
When I got into his house we sat down on his couch and rolled up a dime blunt. He rolled amazing blunts so this one was tight and burned perfectly. When we started smoking, it seemed to last for hours. First we just took 2 hits then passed. Then we started blowing shotguns then started playing hit and hold. By the time we were done with the blunt, I was the highest I had been sinse I started smoking. My eyes were twitching back and fourth, and I had a new perception on what was going on around me. Everything playing on his TV seemed fake and planned out. Nothing was real, it even seemed that everything that was going on around us seemed fake and planned out, like it was all just a big play and everyone was following a script. It seemed as if people were doing things for attention rather than for the pure enjoyment of it. And everything was very awkward in its appearance. Each minute ticked by like an hour and it eventually came to a point where time seemed to stand still. Sort of like if you were on Acid but a much cleaner sense of everything. <BR>

When I left his house, driving back to my friends house who had sold me out earlier, it seemed like I was back on the strip in Las Vegas. Everything was bright and potent, colors were sharper than they had ever been. The greens in the trees lining the roads were brighter than usual, like someone had just painted them and they reached out to me. When I got my friends page I picked him up and went to chill at the lake by his community. There everything began to make sense. Everything that happened around us seemed to have a reason and that reason was so obvious. But not only that, the reasons were stupid beyond a doubt. Something that no person would ever think of if he was sober. As the night grew later, I realized that I needed to go home. The drive home was the most amazing thing. It felt like I was in a video game and everything was fake. Not something I would recommend to most people but for the few times it happens it is an amazing experience. When I got home I stumbled into my room and passed out on my bed, only to wake up the next morning to realize it was one of the most amazing experiences of my life.
