The day before spring break, a friend and I decided to have a little smoke session over at my apartment. We hadn't smoked in over 24 hours, and no other drugs had been taken. Being a novice smoker at the time, my friend offered to introduce me to the gravity bong. There are several different ways to make a gravity bong, but we chose to use a 2-liter soda bottle with the bottom 1/4 cut off. <BR>
<BR>
Preparation included filling the kitchen sink with water, and cutting/burning a hole in the bottle cap so as to insert the bowl on top of it. These activites took longer than anticipated, so we smoked a bowl using a regular pipe as we waited. When everything was ready, we inserted the packed bowl into the bottle cap hole, heated it with a lighter to seal it, and set up the bottle in the sink, w/the cap on top. <BR>
<BR>
After a few hits, I had the rythm and technique down for obtaining extremely large hits. This continued for quite a while, and the bowl seemed to last forever. My friend was able to fill the chamber so full that both of us could get an enormous hit off one pull.<BR>
<BR>
By the end of the second bowl, I felt somewhat tired. The kitchen seemed so strange as a surrounding, and the light intensity seemed different from normal. My arms and legs were too heavy to move, and I put my head down. The conversation with my friend stopped, and I sat with my head down for a long time. During that time, I was able to see scenes of mixed colors and shapes, that appeared almost as if I had made them appear. <BR>
<BR>
After a while I got up and my friend left. I went to my bedroom, and stared at a car poster with glowing headlights--this intrigued me for at least 5 minutes, and I was able to see things in the glowing headlights. Then I closed my eyes and saw shapes and colors again, except I could control them and make them do what I wanted.<BR>

This experience, different from my normal high, seemed to last hours, but when I 'woke up,' I called my friend and told him, and he said it had only been a few minutes since he had left. I haven't felt anything like that since then, but the effect sparked my interest in 'tripping substances.'
