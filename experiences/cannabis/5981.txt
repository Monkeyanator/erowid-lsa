I hit the joint about 6 or 8 times as it passed around the ring.  About 15 minutes after lighting it up I started to smoke a cigarette because I always crave ciggs after getting high.  I started to feel weak and stupid, just basically weird.  As time passed it got much worse and I was feeling mentally retarded and physically very shitty.  I felt a tightness in my chest that made me feel like my heart was weak and my thoughts were going way too deep and in the most odd directions.  Like I would look at the table (we were on my pool deck sitting around a table) and I would think, 'look at the table,' nothing else.  Then I would think, 'why am I thinking about the table?'  Then, 'wow what the F*** is wrong with me?'  <BR>

I would breathe irregularly and move very uncomfortably.  I felt really deranged and crazy.  I pictured myself in the most horrible way that I couldn't even explain if I tried.  Like I was at the lowest level of thinking and I couldn't do anything about it.  I went inside and got a drink of water. Feeling a little better after my walk inside, I sat in the bathroom just in case.  I didn't spew, but I still felt horrible.  The only thing I could do is wait there for it to go away.  Still feeling mental, I went in my room and sat by the computer; then my 2 friends came inside from the deck.  I sat by the computer just thinking about how nothing was happening but us 3 just sitting there, we were listening to music and I realized the lameness of the situation.  Three stoners sitting listening to techno, I couldn't help but think the worst of everything. <BR>

This has happened about the last 6 or so times that I smoked pot.  I think maybe somehow I grew allergic to it or something.  Or maybe it's mixing bad with my DXMed out brain, who knows. Because of this I don't think I'll be smoking much anymore. :(
