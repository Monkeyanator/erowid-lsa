Two days ago, I got a hold of a big bag of Salvia from a friend. The day I got it, another friend and I got stoned and then smoked a salvia joint with no apparent results. Then yesterday, I rolled a joint mostly with salvia but also with a little pot, and I got pretty high. I'm sure that the salvia had a hand in it. The amount of pot just wouldn't do that.<BR>
 <BR>
This morning, I refered to the web looking for the most effective way to smoke it without having to worry about drawing an extract. It turns out that it works better if it's smoked through a bowl. Also one must hold hits as long as possible. Lacking a bowl, I packed a bunch of it in my old trumpet mouth piece. I went out to my patio, put on a phish boot and took four, maybe five big hits, holding each for fifteen to twenty seconds. <BR>
Within a minute of the first hit, i got a massive head rush.<BR>

I started feeling sort of like I was on DXM, except without the chemical vibe to it. Sitting there, in the shade on my patio, where I've had so many good times with friends and alone, reflecting on life as well as living, I listened to the song. It was Walfredo which is a relatively simple song with a weird sort of feel-goodish vibe to it. I felt the song in a cool new way but I wasn't really satisfied with what was going on. I noticed my mind interpretting all objects as having human-type spirits. This is was involuntary; I couldn't not do it. I had also had this happen to me the other day after smoking the mostly salvia + some pot joint. I was washing the dishes and I had a telepathic conversation with the window concerning how it was painted shut, and how I should go about getting it open. <BR>
<BR>
Then I fucked up my trip. Rather than yielding to the altered state and flowing with it, I decided to undertake several tasks. I let the dog in, I turned off the c.d. player and brought it inside, I started to write an e-mail but didn't, and I started to take a shower but didn't. I was pissed off, depressed and lonely all of a sudden. I wandered into the den, wrapped up in a blanket and lay there feeling bad, after a while dozing off.<BR>
I enjoy my thoughts under the influence of this beautiful plant.<BR>
<BR>
The buzz hasn't really been all that pleasant, but then again I feel that the manner in which i did it (alone, out of boredom, and refusing to deeply pursue my thoughts), was abusing it. I'm definitely gonna do it again, but after this bag runs out, I dont think I'll ever actively pursue again. It's cool. It's a cool thing.
