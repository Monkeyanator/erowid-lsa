One day, I heard about anesthetic ether and what the effects are, so I decided to try it. I went out and bought a can a starting fluid, and seperated the ether from the other chemicals with water and put it in a liter jar.<BR>

It was on the way to school last week when I took a rag in my friends car and soaked it with ether, my friends thought I was crazy so they wouldn't try it with me but the windows were up so they caught a buzz. I put the rag to my face and took a few deep breaths and within a matter of seconds I felt this extreme rush flow through my body, but I kept breathin', after a few more seconds I was just delerious staring into thin air and wasn't aware I was still huffing the ether so I took it off my face and had no idea what was goin on around me, sounds were distorted, my vision was blurred and I was laughing histaricly. We finaly got to school and I got out of the car to only find I couldn't walk let alone even stand up straight, my friends were laughing their asses off watching me tryin' to walk up to school. After about 20-30 min it finaly wore off. It was fun but the taste is unbearable. My friend caught a nice buzz cuz he left his headlights on and his battery was dead when school got out. <BR>

'We had 2 bags of grass, 75 pellets of mescaline, five sheets high powered blotter acid, a salt shaker half full of cocaine, a quart of rum, a quart of tequila, a case of budweiser, also a pint of raw ether and two dozen amyls..The only thing that worried me was the ether, theres nothing more helpless and irresponsible than a man in the depths of an ether binge.'<BR>
