I think I'd better get this down....<BR>
<BR>
About an hour and a half ago I decided to try taking nutmeg.  After reading many experience reports about it, i decided i wasn't game to take it orally, so a crushed up a nut, and over about 10 mins, smoked half the nut in about 3 or 4 small piles, which i lit, let burn out, then a large amount of smoke would pour out, which i inhaled.<BR>
<BR>
The first effects came on quick, i felt my heartrate increase, i felt kinda jittery (still do a bit), like caffeine.  After that, i started to feel more lightheaded, and spaced-out. If i close my eyes now, i feel swaying motion, similar to being drunk. My limbs are rather heavy, and i feel lazy.<BR>
In addition i've just noticed that high-pitched sounds are very irritating, almost gives me a headache.<BR>

Up until now, it hasn't been anything great, maybe if i were to smoke a bit more, or extract the oils and smoke them freebase...
