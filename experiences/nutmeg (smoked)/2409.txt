I've been experimenting with nutmeg latly since I have been under the law's hand.  In all my experiences ranging from 3tsp. to 40 grams consumed there was never really any thing that was the same in all of them, except one: with smaller doses the effects are definatly not as intense (made me drowsy) with larger doses I felt stoned or tired, sick, and jaded.  Also I always spaced my experiments at least 5 days apart (you probably would do the same just because of the after effects).  One side effect that always was the same the more I took the more sick I felt when coming down.  <BR>

Some time after I had taken the most I had ever taken (40 grams) I decided to try smoking the nasty shit.  So after a small school dance where I had taken 2 caffien pills at 9pm I came home at 11pm and took 4 presciption sleeping pills (not my prescription) the instructions were to take 1 to 3. From then till 12 am I smoked a joint of nutmeg with breaks. I didn't feel anything from it and about two hours later I went to sleep.<BR>

The next morning I had to get up at 8 and go to an air show in 90 degree wheather. I felt really jaded and kind of sick but I was fine except the heat. Later that evening about 5pm I felt like I was coming down with the flu (nausea and I was still really jaded and a bit confused and slow).  That went away except feeling jaded and slow about an hour or so later, Then at about 7:30 or 8 I had a small pizza for dinner at a restaurant and bread which I shared with my grand father.  Almost immediatly I felt neausiated after the pizza.  I thought I was just full but later realized it was the nutmeg.  I went back to my grandfather's house to stay the night. I went right to my bed and tryed to sleep but just dozed off. <BR>

At about 9pm I ran to the bathroom and puked up all my dinner, I felt horrible. Defiantly felt like the flu but it seemed too intense, I thought maybe it was food poisoning. I felt like a heroine addict going through withdrawls. I was teribly tired but wired and very sick.  I threw up every thing. The only releif I was getting was after I puked.  At 3 am I realized this wasn't going away so my grand father took me to the hospital. I was so agrivated and everything took extra extra effort. I told the doc only about the caffien pills and  the sleeping pills. He said it shouldn't have been because of those. So a long stay at the hospital where I was given an iv cause I was dehydrated (I was so cold) and some medicine that took away my neausea, plus a piss and blood test.  No illeagle drugs but there were a few things in my piss that were too high or too low, same with my blood.  Especially my lymphocyte count was way down.  My conclusion is I contracted the flu virus from my dad because he got it when I did and I think the nutmeg damaged my immune system so much I wasn't able to fight off the virus as well. I am convinced that it was the nutmeg due to my past experiences and others I have read about.  I however am not sure because I smoked the nutmeg instead of eating it that damaged my immune system more, perhaps I was never exposed to an illness while on nutmeg.  Either way my advice is don't smoke fucking nutmeg.
