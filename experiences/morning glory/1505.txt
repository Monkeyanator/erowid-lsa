I was skeptical about MG's, but I decided to try any way, I went to my local H&E (Imagine getting drugs at a HARDWARE store!!!) and bought 6 1.5G packs of seeds. I put the seeds in a sunglass bag (strecthy, so it wouldnt rip) and beat the hell out of them for 10 mins or so with a hammer, which left me with a fine, white-brown powder, actually resembling heroin, or sugarcane sugar. I proceeded to put the seed powder in a 5 oz cup, and poured in enough Dr. Pepper to fill the glass, I let it soak for about 10 mins, I then drank it as fast as I could, pulp and all. I also ate a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. <br>

After about 45 minutes to an hour, I started to feel 'funny' It was similar to an LSD trip, but more so like a Psylocybin feeling. After about 3 hours, I began to trip VIVIDLY. I was watchin a Cheech and Chong flick, and it became hard to follow the action, with my perception bordering on un-controllable. The trip was still going strong after 6 hours, when I went to sleep (I didnt notice any sleepless-ness from the seeds) All in all, I would have to say, its a good way to kill some time, and if you get a few friends to go in on a pound of seeds, WAAAAY cheaper than ACID or Shroomies..... Happy Trippin!
