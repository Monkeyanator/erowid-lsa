INTERFACING WITH MOTHER AND FATHER<br>
<br>
<br>
OKAY. Friday morning 11Am I'm surfing the web looking at all the pretty flowers when I notice a trumpet looking flower that grows in the Mexican mountians. I put 2 and 2 together and concluded MEXICAN TRUMPETS! My mother grows those in the back yard and had about a cereal bowl worth of pods on the window cell.<br>
<br>
I consol my friend jamie on the internet telling him about my new found discovery.'D00d' he says, you have to take alot of those. He is my faithful comrade and we have tripped many times on other substances so I took his word for it. <br>
<br>
Its now 12Pm, I have a Docs app at 4:30 And this site says this Glory Drug produces mild LSD effects. Ok so I start munchin, The whole 1/2 cereal bowl worth of seeds (careful opening the pods, those spikes stay in your palms for weeks)which ammounted to about 1000 seeds If I remember correctly(little did I know) that was 400 seeds over the maximum recommended doseage.<br>
<br>
Okay I have 4 hours to kill, moms home, dad will be home in 20 minutes, Ill take a quick shower, come down grab a cigarette, and reside in my bedroom untill this kicks in.<br>
<br>
Well, I get into the bathroom and look myself in the mirror, pupils have started dialateing allready! Its only been 10 minutes , how strong is this shit?!?well I get nakid and just as I swing my head around to turn the faucet, BAM!total lag, the frames from 3 seconds ago caught up to me like a lion on zebras ass. Oh shit! I have a doctors app in 4 hours, I started laughing like a madman, that dam jamie set me up for a journey worthy of a well seasoned shaman!!MUAhaha.<br>
<br>
I get downstairs, In a pair of jeans, somehow make myself a cup of java and make my way out on the front porch to have a cigarette. I hear my mother calling me from inside and I respond with a weak'Yeaaa?' It was like I was so far inside the realms of the unknown that I couldnt force my voice from whever I was at, Into my lungs and out my mouth. It sounded like I was listening to a voice recording of myself from an answering machine.<br>
<br>
I sneak past the watchful eye of my mother and have a seat by the back door just in time to greet my father as he walks in . 'Jaffo' He asks me 'Do we have realplayer on our computer'? The sentence I composed within my head came out of my mouth as a mess of jibbrish!'what?'he asks me with a simpathetic laugh(He is accustom to my vision questing but has never seen me in this condition) My mother was kind enough to reply for me 'HE'S FUCKING HIGH, LISTEN TO HIM! LOOK AT HIS EYES! HE CANT UNDERSTAND A FUCKING WORD YOUR SAYING!!' <br>
<br>
Normally my mother is the kindest hearted woman on earth so you can imagine what a supprise this was to me. I turned beat red. I had all the answers but could not for the life of me force the words out of my mouth. 'He can understand me just fine' My father assured her with a smile.All this negitivity on my mothers behaf put me in quite a state of shock.<br>
<br>
'PACK YOUR FUCKING BAGS!YOUR OUT OF HERE JAFFO I CANT PUT UP WITH THIS SHIT ANYMORE!YOUR GONE!GET OUT!(Okay, I'm taking a computer science corse which is worth about15 thousand Canadian dollers,(which she is paying for) I have No friends that live on their own, she made it clear that she will make sure my brother wont take me in)Tho he would have, nothing, no future, I'm going to be a bum just because my mother is too weak minded to enjoy the finer things in life.<br>
<br>
Too make an extremely long story short. The fucking guy in the mirror was mimmicing my EVERY move, I remember slipping in and out of consicousness many times, I over flowed the bath tub, talked with an assortment of appliances within the house.<br>
<br>
This I dont remember but my Dad was kind enough to update me 2 days later when I emerged.I took single rolls of toilet paper, placed them in single BIG black garbage bags and placed those at strategic points throughout the house, the microwave, the stove, on the TV ect...I filled the Brita Water filter Jug with milk for some reason, drank tobacco from a canester infront of ym father and his good friend thinking it was water.OW! I seen the most beautiful jet black galixy when it was suppose to be daylight with amazing stars and comets out my kitchen window.Pure lunacy.<br>
<br>
<br>
I hope this shows all you people that have not tryed mind expanding drugs that NEGITIVITY is not good at any time, at all costs remain positive and you will be OKAY.Make sure your well informed about the drug that you are taking and unless you are nmormally on the loony side In normal reality I do not recommend taking 1000 Seeds of Morning Glory in one Sitting.<br>
<br>
I give that trip 5stars most definetly!<br>
