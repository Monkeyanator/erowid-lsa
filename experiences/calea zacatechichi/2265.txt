(Calea Zacatechichi-or close, the 'Dream Herb') I purchased this product in form of herb and extracted juice to experiment with. My purpose was to use it as a vehicle to strengthen my dreams to communicate better or more clearly with that which is the source of our dreams, whether it be our higher selves, or spirit guides, or ?. Accompanied dosages with forms of prayer. Started small doses, ended up eventually with megadoses, but still no effect in the dreamworld. Only slight change in consciousness when awake. As far as my experience went, was useless and I abandoned it. --//JM
