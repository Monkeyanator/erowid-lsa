I'd read in the Ibogaine entry by Shulgin that Tabernaemontana spp. were an area worth investigating. I found an extract at an online vendor of Tabernaemontana Sanango extract sold in a 1 oz. bottle. The extract is brownish and smells like grain alcohol. Not having any clue as to how much to try, I risked 4 droppers full in a glass of grapefruit juice. Down the hatch! It didn't affect the taste of the juice much. <BR>

(T 1:30) At this point I am feeling slighlty relaxed and a mild intoxication. This could all still be placebo. It must also be noted that on the night prior I had taken 2-CT-7 and was barely able to grab three hours of sleep. Fatigue is part of the mixture here. I have also not eaten all day either.<BR>

(T: 2:40) Inside out 420. I smoked a small bowl of MJ. The CEVs I usually experience from MJ seemed rather intense and more vivid. Again, this could all still be placebo. I have an over active imagination sometimes.<BR>
<BR>
(T 3:00) At this point I am floating in a soft dreamlike awareness. I am aware of the room around me, but it all seems unreal somehow. Grainy in appearance. I begin to slip in and out of mental imagery. For instance, there was an instance in which I was picturing the stone walls of a castle. After a few seconds of trying to focus on these walls, I drifted off into a scenario where a woman in full medieval dress and I where discussing something (I have no recollection what). Stuff like that went on for another hour, until my brother knocked on my door. I was very near sleep before he knocked. I was a bit upset. I wonder if I would have been able to enter a lucid dream state had I not been disturbed. I've been trying to get lucid for 3 years with no real luck yet. Blargh.<BR>

(T 5:30) I can feel a slightly pleasant hangover feeling in my temples. A chemical massage sort of. Everthing else has diminished into a slight euphoric languor. I feel confident that 4 droppers was a small amount to ingest. I will go for 6-8 next time. I was really intrigued at the dream state I was in. The vendor's description of this extract claimed it had been used as a mental tonic to revive the elderly, and to improve the vision of hunters. SO, I'm guessing the fatigue + 1,4 butanediol + MJ created the dream state, while the Sanago helped me maintain a certain alertness, an ability to remain conscious of what my mind was doing on auto pilot. All in all this was a rather enjoyable experience. I feel well rested and in a good cheer.
