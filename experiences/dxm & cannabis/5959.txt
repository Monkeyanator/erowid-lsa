<!--despite being riddled with spelling and punctuation errors, this piece has an interesting part about interfacing with his mom, 'Trying to act normal was impossible, after i found out she knew i was up to something real wierd i totally spilled my guts to her. I told her everything i had done bad tonight and anything i could think bad about my life. (It was very hard to talk i could only say about 3-4 words at a time) I also told her how dumb i was to do this and that it was the worst experiance of my life. We really connected that night because she had similar stories to tell too. Alot of things i didnt know about her i found out that night and the other way around for her to me. .....I also told my mom that i wanted to try acid real bad and this changed my mind and that i was gonna turn my life around and stop doing any dumb ass shit like this. I told her everything without even thinking!' --><BR>

Its about 1:30pm the next day after my experiance(about 14 hours since i drank the bottle). Back to 100% normal. It all started after school on a thursday... i was looking for something more than weed to do for that night so i started reading alot up on DXM. After i went and got my 4oz Rbotussin Max Strength cough bottle, active ingredients DXM-Hbr, i decided to start a trip journal because i wanted people to know about my experiance with the robo. Im gonna tell you word for word what my journal said, i didnt change any words around or anything. Before this experiance ive smoked weed almost every night to calm me down before sleep, ive took a selection of pills also including xanax, coricidon, and ecstasy twice. All pleasant times. The worst was yet to come with DXM. Oh and im 16 years old about 6'ft 155lb live with both parants and a younger brother. It was a paper journal that i was writing in from my room. I have a very cool and trippy room. All words in (these things) are things i didnt actually write but came up with the next day, things i didnt think about writing.<BR>
<BR>
8:10 - Reporting to my trip journal for the first time. Planning on drinking my 4oz bottle of robo and smoke some weed tonight. Ive cleaned my room to make it a pleasant place for my trip. I feal ready for what im about to do. I've done much research for my experiance. Very anxious. Will be back when its safe to start.<BR>
<BR>
11:20 - Just drank 4oz robo, ate some crackers and drank alot of orange juice hoping that they would help my stomach. Shit was nasty but i could get it down without gagging.<BR>
<BR>
11:40 - Just chillin in my room waiting on any changes to occur. Going to go smoke a bowl or 2. Be back. Not feeling anything wierd.<BR>
<BR>
11:50 - Just smoked a bowl. Might be feeling things? Kinda feel like this place in unfamiliar. Usually know exactly where things are in the dark. At one time i was trying to find the computer thought i had found it and was at the kitchen sink 5 feet away! Going to chill here for about 10 minutes and listen to music. Listening to three-six mafia, starting to get into the music, might of been the weed though.<BR>
<BR>
12:00 - Going to smoke a joint in a couple minutes. Walking around in a dark house is similar to walking around in a blank tv screen but you know where to turn and go. Becoming hard to remember how to spell words out to write them. Forgetting things fast. Definatly feeling effects of the cough syrup. Getting real tuned into music. Getting real messed up dawg HAHAHA! Whoa i just laughed out loud. Going to smoke that joint now, be back.<BR>
<BR>
12:10 - You know what i just realized?! Joints are AWESOME! Getting real hyper and giddy. Now i know why its called getting high of cough syrup. Cause im the highest ive ever been, like a hyper, happy high.<BR>
<BR>
12:30 - Writing has turned to scrible. Feal sooo good right now. Strobe light vision kicking in. Fealing light and floaty like. Just smoked some more bowls. When its dark you can see into infinitie like space. Wierd shit here. Going to watch some winamp on the computer.(never made it there, probly would of got lost if i tried)<BR>
<BR>
12:50 - sight wont stop moving even if i try my hardest to focus on something. Crackers are nasty because my mouth is so dry. I can hardly write anymore. Very light on my feet. I cant see what im writing anymore (next few lines i couldnt read)I get more fucked up everytime i talk to this journal. Cant focus for shit, keep forgetting where the notebook is when i come to write shit. Fealing gravity pulling me to the floor as hard as it can. Sup Jason and redline, Master-P 4 life (i guess thats what i was listening to at the time and i was thinking about who would read this first) Jason your my boy dawg... cant write no more , chicken scratch is a good example of how i was writing.<BR>
<BR>
1:05 - *NOTE* smoking supplies under bathroom sink. Getting real sick going to puke (it was motion sickness cuz my vision would never stop moving and when i closed my eyes i would see more than my eyes would see open which made me real real sick) Just puked about 25 times. For some reason sticking my head in and hugging that toilet was the greatest feeling. That was fun PUKING! (little did i know that i would spend the rest of the night turning my stomach inside out into the toilet)<BR>
<BR>
1:?? - Im in the bathroom smoking some more... vision very flashy (like i would see what my eyes would see then id see black all under a second a million miles an hour a million times) Real messed up off this shit. My high is going strait up and is not stopping. Going to explode. First closed eye vision, I saw a vision of a snakes head and found myself acting like a snake on my bed. Cant write anymore, cant see paper or spell out a word correctly. Easy to see closed eye visuals. What i thought would appear. Double vision even if i tried to see it as one. I could move the second vision of my TV where ever i wanted it. I hallucianted alot that night.<BR>
<BR>
--------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>
After this point i stopped writing because i simply couldnt move.<BR>
I cant remember anything after this point either but a couple small memories of my mom. I had started to have a very bad trip. My mom woke up because i had wet a hole towel i put it on me, i guess that was loud. Trying to act normal was impossible, after i found out she knew i was up to something real wierd i totally spilled my guts to her. I told her everything i had done bad tonight and anything i could think bad about my life. (It was very hard to talk i could only say about 3-4 words at a time) I also told her how dumb i was to do this and that it was the worst experiance of my life. We really connected that night because she had similar stories to tell too. Alot of things i didnt know about her i found out that night and the other way around for her to me. I was very dehidriated and had many hot flashes. I thought i couldnt live without a cold wet rag somewhere on my body. My insides and outsides were melting away. I also told my mom that i wanted to try acid real bad and this changed my mind and that i was gonna turn my life around and stop doing any dumb ass shit like this. I told her everything without even thinking! The hardest thing that night was actually finding the bathroom that is only 5 feet away from my bedroom door. I never tried to get to the computer.. if i did, i would probly of got lost and never would of found my way back. I wish i did go to the computer winamp would of been real awesome.<BR>

The whole night I was pretty much puking orange juice. I think i drank a 2liter of OJ i cant remember , i woke up and it was empty. Sometime that night after puking I had turned the light off to stop my dizzieness. I believed that i had got upducted by aliens that were going to work on me soon and the only way to stop them was to turn the light back on. Seriously took 15 minutes to find the switch ,i was in space, very scary I freaked out very badly even though i knew it wasnt true, Also I had a very messed up walk like it was my first time using my body. And i didnt know how to function. Some people refer the walk to the 'Robo Walk'. I finally fell asleep sometime.. 4-6am? with my mom by my side, and slept till 1:00 today. Overall this experiance was the worst thing ive ever lived through and id never do it again. I learned alot of things that night though. Be careful with what you do and take make sure your ready for the things your gonna do. I thought i was.
