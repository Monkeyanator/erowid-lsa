It was around 4:15 pm on a friday afternoon. I came from school with my buddy.  I got another call from one of my friends and said he was coming over.  He came over.  I had second thoughts if I should take it- so I tried to sell it to the other kid who came over.  He wouldn't buy it, and he also said he wouldn't leave until I tried it.  So I was like what the hell, why not, so I downed it.  And he left.  This was the night of the first football game- with a prediction of 20,000 people there.  So me and my bud leave for the game around 5:00.  The only thing I'm feeling is that 'I gotta shit but I can't' feeling.  The traffic is really bad- we dont get to the game till 6:00 PM.  I start to feel the effects when I get out of the car (feeling weird, wavy motions).  We walked about a half a mile till we got to the stadium.  <BR>

Then around 7:00, it started to really pick up.  I'm at a stadium with 20,000 other people yelling and shouting.  I forgot who I was or what I was doing.  I tried to stay close to my friend- I couldn't afford to lose him- my vision got worse.  He told me at one second my pupils were the size of dots, then they grew so he couldnt see the color part in my eyes.  At 7:30- I started to FLIP out.  I was hearing and seeing things- I was blacking out, it seemed like everyone had their eyes on me, and all the police there made me crazy.  I have to admit- the visuals were awesome.  I saw people with motorcycles on the field running over the football players.  <BR>

Time was so distorted(as everything else was).  I told my friend I couldn't handle being at a football game so we left to go bowling.  It was around 8:30 when we left the game an headed to the alley.  It looked like the stop lights were on the ground, my friend looked like a skeleton, and I felt like I was sliding in my seat.  When we arrived at the bowling alley (8:45) I said i cant go in there- so I stayed in the car.  Most of the time I was in the car, I was in the fetal position under a blanket- I kept on moving.  I then stared at my hands- they looked HUGE.  My friend came out from the alley (it felt like he was in there for an eternity) he really only played 3 games.  <BR>

I dunnot know what time we left- but I know we got back to my house around 11:30.  We played games at my house (I felt a whole lot calmer since I was in my house, and not an unknown place).  Then my friend had to leave around 12:30.  So I tried to go to bed (the effects were still there) but I just couldn't.  I kept rollin in my bed- just moving around.  I finally got to sleep around 4:30.  The next day when I woke up, I still had some trails and my pupils were still big, but my parents didn't notice.  I rate this as an awesome (but intense) experience and would definitely do it again.
