1:00Pm: Took 20mg of amt snorted. Burned like a bitch.  Immediately went into the shower, thinking i had plenty of time before it kicked in.  Wrong.  My nose and sinuses started to sing like crazy, maybe because of the steam in the air opening up my mucous membranes.  Accelleration was gradual, but still slightly unsettling.  Like, 'damn, am i high yet?'<BR>

3:00Pm: I think I hit my peak at this point, but i couldn't really tell. I just felt 'high' in a very non-specific way.  Very, very light visual distortions.  Almost 'sparkley' but nothing too intense.  My friend, who joined me in this outing, went with me to the top of a high point in the city.  It was amazing.  The breath taking view really overpowered the drug, and while i was up there i didn't feel high anymore.  I was happy and incredibly energetic, though still managed to be relaxed at the same time.  I was alert, and very lucid.  What a wonderful drug.<BR>

6:00Pm: Side-effects start to really kick in.  I normally get similar effects with any drug containing 'methyl'.  Foxy, e, and now amt produced jaw clenching, blurred vision, mild muscle spasms, and restlessness.  Positive effects are still in place, however.  I found amt to be slightly entactogenic and more than slightly empathogenic. I can see how at much higher doses that a portion of the trip can feel like 'peak candyflipping' as has been described to me.  <BR>

11:00Pm: Watched the life of brian, and started to get a fucking brutally splitting headache, as did my companion.  Ibuprofin fixed this, but the tightness in my face didn't go away until the next morning.  This may have been the result of snorting the amt because my face was in pain for a good 2 hours after the insufflation, for some reason it may have returned.<BR>

All in all, i'd be interested in doing it again, but not snorting it.  I would also be interested to know how much the age of the substance contributed to (or detracted from) the experience.  I'd be curious to try some fresh amt next time.
