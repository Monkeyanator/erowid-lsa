This past weekend brought a Sci-Fi Marathon at a local college. This is a very popular time for people to take psychedelics and stare at aliens for twelve hours. I decided it would be a good time to try AMT. I'd heard about its six hour peak and it's 24-26hr overall experience, so I was excited to spend most of the marathon tripping.<BR>
<BR>
I ate 45mg AMT at 8pm, shortly after eating a small amount of couscous (remember, eat MAOI-friendly foods). At around 8:30pm I went to the marathon to watch movies while I came up. I felt slight hints of what was to come, mostly bodily anxiety, around 9:15pm. I had heard that AMT's second hour was unpleasant and I was starting to feel a little cold, so I went to a friend's room and chilled there for a while as the AMT was taking effect. I began to feel better around 11:45pm, and decided that I was going to be tripping soon so I grabbed a blanket and set out for the marathon. At 12:10pm I entered the room, not tripping at all. By the time I'd walked across the back of the room to meet my friends (about 15 seconds), I was tripping my balls off. This was to continue for the next 13 hours.<BR>
<BR>
The trip was almost purely visual; I felt like I was thinking very normally and I wasn't experiencing any aural effects (as I do with most other drugs I've tried), but I was being saturated by *strong* tryptamine visuals the entire time. There was a speedy effect; I was constantly wringing my hands (which felt a little like MDMA-hands in the first three hours of the peak) and fidgeting. There were also jaw clenches that put those I experiences on MDA to shame, and my pupils were enormous. I noticed a sense of time warping; before I knew it, one or two hours had passed.<BR>
<BR>
Since there was no mindfuck about AMT, the marathon was only marginally interesting, and so I spent a lot of time elsewhere. Around 5am I went to join my friends at their dorm. Most of them had taken some ass-whooping LSD and were coming down, and a handful of them had taken some 2C-T-7 and were still flying. I smoked a few bowls with people, and noticed very little synergy between AMT and marijuana (although it's still delightful). By 7am I noticed the visuals diminishing, and by 8am they were getting faint. Around 11am I went to my girlfriend's room to sleep, and proceeded to fidget and toss and turn and eventually resign myself to the fact that I was going to be awake for a little longer. I put some good music on, quietly, and eventually dozed off for a couple of hours around 3pm.<BR>
<BR>
I awoke at 5pm with a slight headache and eyeache, but other than that I felt fine. I took some ibuprofen and set out for home to make dinner, and I slept very well that night.<BR>
<BR>
Conclusions: AMT was much less intellectual (i.e., not at all) than I would have liked, but it was fun. It felt like a pure, strong version of the 'tryptamine signature' you read about here; I'd never been able to put my finger on it, but after experiencing 13 hours of it, I think I can do so now. I'm not anxious to do it again, but it was a fun way to spend a weekend.<BR>

PS- oh, make sure you have some Bazooka gum or a teething ring or something. :)<BR>
