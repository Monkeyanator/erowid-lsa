I had read a lot about Morning Glories so I decided to try them.  I went to the local Home Depot and bought like 6 or 7  packages of Burpee Morning Glory Seeds, Heavenly Blue variety. I went home and got out the manual pepper grinder and began to grind.  (Do make sure you clean out the pepper first!)  Anyways, after grinding and grinding, it was done.<BR>
<BR>
I took a vitamin C pill (1000 mg). I had the seed grindings in a cup.  I pored some orange juice in there and swirled and mixed. I have read that nausea is caused by 'little stringy things'.  I noticed these, and I did get nausea. I let it sit in the cup for about 20 minutes.  Then I drank it all.  It wasn't that bad really, but I should have filtered out the solids.<BR>
I drank it all down and went outside to plant some California Poppies (which are now growing very well :).<BR>
<BR>
After about 20 minutes or so, I began to get some nausea.  I went in and laid down on the bed. Ten more minutes (+30) and I began to feel first effects: a mild glow like an hour after weed and a little acid mixed in.  The nausea got worse, and after trying to hold it down, I threw up in the bathroom.  <BR>
<BR>
But oh man!  After that, it was like a huge relief, I felt absolutely no more nausea.  It began to get more and more like a weak acid trip.<BR>
<BR>
I was very calm and laughed quite a bit. <BR>
<BR>
I can say that it lasted like this for about 3.5-4 hours.<BR>
<BR>
I felt very good the next day too.<BR>
<BR>
I would recommend this to anyone, especially if short on cash!!<BR>
<BR>
Thanks! Legalize it!
