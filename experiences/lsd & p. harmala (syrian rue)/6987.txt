This past weekend a couple of friends and I decided to have a LAN party with a little acid twist.  I had brought a small vial of trips back with me from college, not the best stuff, kinda short.  I got up to my friend's house at about 8:30 pm and we began setting up the computers.  Once things were set up, we dropped at about 10:30.  About an hour before that, one of my friends and myself ate some Syrian Rue resin that I had cooked up earlier in the week.<BR>

It was an expirement. I had tried Rue with Shrooms before with very positive results, and was hoping for similar effects on LSD (with shrooms it was quite calming, and prolonged the expirence by a couple hours at least)..  by 11:30 we were trippin pretty hard, we tested out our games, which consisted of Need for Speed 5: Porsche (Very FUN)... Quake 3 (Also quite enjoyable).. and Half-Life: Counter-Strike (My friends were completely clueless on this one.  More funny than fun.. Watching them play with their flashlights and blast each other even though they were teammates)...  In my opinion, cid and LAN games go quite well together, although it's not as introspective as just chillin to some music, it gives you something fun to do as a group.  While the acid died down by about 5:00 am we stayed up all night racing and killing each other, with blatant disregard for sleep.<BR>

Unfortunately, the rue seemed to have absolutely no effect on the trip, duration and effects were similar for all three of us, regardless.  Take care, happy trippin.
