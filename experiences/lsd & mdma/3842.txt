It was an epic night.  Myself and 3 of my friends attended a rave in a nearby suburban hell-hole of a town.  It was my first rave but I pretty much knew what to expect... or so I thought.  Upon arrival we each took 2 drops of the liquid.  About 15-30 minutes later I bought and ate the roll.  I've had lots of previous experience with acid and wasn't really expecting to trip hard off 2 drops but I was dead wrong.  This was *good* acid. <BR>
<BR>
I could feel the trip coming on about 30 minutes after ingestion, which was just after I had taken the pill.  I never exactly felt the effects of the MDMA I was used to, it just made my trip a hell of a lot more emotional and intense.  I 'felt' the visuals of the acid.  My body became part of the swirling colors and I felt like a glowing body of mush the whole night.  It felt as though every cell in my body was flowing with the rest of the world.  Needless to say it was a beautiful feeling, as opposed to the gritty tense body buzz I usually get from acid.<BR>
<BR>
Around 4 hours into the party it was shut down by the police which was quite a downer.  As we were about to get into my car to go home I realized all I had on me was the ignition key to the car.  The door key was locked inside!  No one freaked out, per se... the vibe of the night just became very tense.  After another hour or two it was finally decided to smash in a window.  At this point I couldn't tell if I was still flippin' on the drugs or not, I was just upset.<BR>
<BR>
The deed was done with a huge rock. (thanks Krafty!!!!)  It worked well though as my skinny friend was able to slide through the window and unlock the door.  Now, late November in Wisconsin is cold (it was around 20 degrees that night), but cold doesn't begin to describe the feeling of flying down the highway at 65mph for 45 minutes with an open window.<BR>
<BR>
The ride home was when I began to fully appreciate the drugs.  My trip came flying back at me with full force.  The night sky, the world, was absolutely livid with the most beautiful flowing energy I had ever seen.  The organizers of the rave had turned to the radio after the party was shut down and they were playing the same music as they were at the party!<BR>
<BR>
There was a slight sense of panic in me though, during the car ride.  For some reason I became scared there would be no society for us to return to...which was actually kind of intruiging!  There were lots of semis on the road and hardly any other cars and it seemed as though everyone was going 100mph.  My friend commented 'There's so many semis... it's like a weird underworld of semi traffic.'<BR>

As we rolled into Madison around 3a.m. I was in awe of the human creation that is a city.  The streets were empty but there was so much energy around it was unbearable.  I couldn't feel the cold any more... only the warmth of life.  A final sigh of relief... 'everything's all right.' =)<BR>

We spent the rest of the morning (until about 7a.m.) smoking Sativa (three cheers for psychoactives!) and tripping out in my friend's apartment.  It was a great bonding experience between all of us and I highly recommend the combination of LSD and MDMA, IF you feel confidant that you can handle yourself on the combination of these two powerful drugs.  Prior experience with each substance by itself is recommended.
