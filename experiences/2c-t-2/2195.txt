Well since it's legal in Holland I gave it some trys. One time I took 8 mg (1 pill) and the effects were like a small dose 2CB or MDMA but milder and lasting longer (8-10 hours). Effects include some Euphoria, mild Empathy, good body feeling, intense colours and kept one somewhat awake and high. Dancing was fun! The effects were not really pronounced at that small dose, but smoking some good weed on it intensified them.<BR>

The other time I took also 8 mg , and after 2 hours I mixed some 10 mg 2CB in it and smoked some bud . The 2CB high was very dominant but was certainly potentiated by the 2ct2. It felt more like 25mg 2CB. There were strong colourfull hallucinations,witch went really synaestetic with music. Strong empathic feelings also. Every hit of bud I smoked sended me into a deep visual inner trance with strong CEV and some acoustic hallucinations.<BR>

Maybe I'll find the time to write a more detailed report on this combination, which was very interesting. There is a report of a similiar combination on the lycaeum site, with similar results.<BR>

Next time I find the time I'll try 16 mg of the 2ct2 to see what effects it has at this dose, but it seems to be a substance which works best in combinations , and seems to be not really amazing on its own.
