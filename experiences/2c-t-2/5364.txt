2PM 	The goal was to take 10mg but ended up with 12 or 13 (too nervous sipping form the vial, I'm afraid.) My partner finished the other 17 or 18.<BR>
<BR>
2:43	I feel cold and chills though the house is warm, and have since ingesting but that could simply be my nervousness which is acute when trying new substances. I notice my typing abilities are becoming strained.<BR>
<BR>
2:51	If I focus I can certainly feel the effects coming on quite strongly now.<BR>
<BR>
2:57	Like a little roller coaster.... here I go again....that was quite strong.<BR>
<BR>
3:10	Here comes another one though not as bad as my partner is here now and that has taken my mind off it. We've both got the 'Yawnies'.<BR>
<BR>
I am aware of a bad/strange taste in my mouth. Must brush my teeth.<BR>
<BR>
3:25	A cold, sharp ramp right now.<BR>
<BR>
3:40	Time is disappearing. Strange to think it's +1:40 into this... Where has the time gone!?<BR>
<BR>
Fully on somewhere around here. Typical rampup like Gleemonex (my nickname for 2cb)<BR>
<BR>
4:20	Mendelhesson, 'Violin Concerto', NY Philharmonic (Bernstein) Pinkus Zuckerman, the 'schmaltzman' himself on violin. He's a very emotional player but the 2ct2 allows me to hear the notes being played without the emotion and I can conectrate on the abilities of the player to master the material. A very exacting listen to this wonderful piece. The music is transparent. One can hear all the parts at the same time. <BR>
<BR>
	Bernstein's 'Overture' from Candide and was at ease in these complicated, comedic, jazzy and dancing rhythms as with the Mendlessohn's schmaltz. <BR>
<BR>
Finding just a hint of my nose running. This phen seems to be clearing out my sinuses as the gleemonex does. If there's a legal use for these babies it's as a sinus declogger.<BR>
<BR>
5:48	Edgar Varese's 'Arcana', <mj booster here> <BR>
	Schoenberg Opus 24 'Serenade', <BR>
	Stravinksy, 'Patsoral and Ebony Concerto'<BR>
<BR>
7:05	Bach's 'Brandenberg Concerto' #6 Allegro, <BR>
	Ravel's 'Daphne and Chloe' and we've had enough.<BR>
<BR>
8:49	Had dinner, soup, salad and rolls, but it was too much, even at that. Wasn't very hungry from the ordeal. Now I'm overheated and warm which was quite a difference from 7 hours ago. My muscles ache too. I've taken a couple ibuprofins that seem to have taken the edge off. A friend suggests a beer.<BR>
<BR>
9:00 	Finished editing the log.
