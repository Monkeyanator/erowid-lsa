It was the long awaited night of my first rave, I have always wanted to go to one because all my friends constantly did but I never had the time to.  Then came the night, everything was organized, we got the pills beforehand and pre-sale tickets and everything.  I arrived at about 10:00 and walked around and got used to the atmosphere and I was having a great time without the pill and was thinking that I didn't need to take it but around 11:00 I just swallowed it for the hell of it.<BR>
<BR>
I asked around about the pill I took (Octagon) and everyone was giving me the same answer and it was a great pill.  I got my mind off that I just took a pill and started dancing, when the main DJ came on the main room was crowded and we were all having a great time, then I remember I blinked and it looked as if I had water in my eyes because everything was all bright, then I took a deep breath and I thought I was having an orgasm.  My knees went weak and I fell to the floor in pure bliss, never has anything in life come close to the feeling I got.<BR>
<BR>
I pulled myself up and this girl came up to me and looked me in the eyes and hugged me and rubbed my back and it was incredible.  Every step I would take would send waves of pleasure through my body, I started talking with new people and they were all so friendly giving me money for drinks and candy to wear.  It was truly heaven, pure peace, what man has been striving for so long, inside of a club.  I couldnt help but dance wildly whenever I moved because it became such a delight.  Every minute that passed the feeling became more intense like a warm massage from the inside.<BR>
<BR>
I was so energetic yet so relaxed and in such a perfect mood, around 11:45 I just couldnt stand up anymore and fell into the middle of a cuddle-puddle. I felt hands all over my body and the smell of vicks all around, I closed my eyes and drifted off.  Nothing could compare to what I was feeling.  My eyes started rolling into the back of my head but I was feeling so good nothing mattered, the night flew by with nothing but positive things happening, when I started to comedown around 6:00 I reflected what a wonderful experience it was.<BR>
<BR>
People know what goes on in these clubs, no one is hurt, people just go to have a wonderful time and everybody does.  I didn't see anyone fighting or getting in a drunken rage like so many other clubs I've been to.  This was truly a Utopia.  Ever since then, nothing has come close to the fun factor that I had that night, I havn't taken E again at the other 4 times I attended Raves because I want the greatest night of my life to be as special as possible.<BR>

I can understand how this can be habit forming, next to Heroin, there is no other pleasure in life this great, it is the true pinnacle of the human psyche, ultimite happiness for 5 hours, but like everything in life, it comes with a price.
