I tried E two times, the first time was GREAT and most of the second one was too, but I think maybe I did them a little to close together, and fear I may have permanent long-term effects.  I took 1 pill during a christmas party and then 2 and 1/2 the day maybe week bfore christmas, maybe a week or two later.  During the second one (the same pills)  I started seeing trails, got cold sweats, got really pale, and thought I was gonna pass out.  Then resumed normal experince.<BR>

Then about 2 weeks afterwards I started getting EXTREEMLY anxious every time I smoked weed.  Now I have horifying panic attacks 3-4 times daily, thinking of suiside sometimes, and wanting to cry but can't.  Whenever I talk about it people get mad at me for saying what what happening, I feel so alone.  I've since given up weed, which I totally blame E for, but the panic attacks still happen, not to the extent that they had though, which I'm glad, but I think I'm gonna have a heart attack every time it does happen.<BR>

I also get very light headed, and sometimes forget to breath.  They happen a lot at night when I'm trying to sleep, and sometimes I wake up and everything's fuzzy.  I'm 20yo and already going gray and balding, I don't think it's from the panic but I'm sure it's not helping.  I'm having an absolutly TERRIBLE experince of the after effects, I URGE you not to try E!!!!STICK TO WEED!!!, it feels good when you do it, but wait a month and the side effects just don't go away.
