I started doing mdma this year. At first it's effects weren't so strong on me so i stupidly decided to double the dose (I started with a pill, ended up takin two), as i desperately tried to feel the same way my friends did. Seems i have trouble letting go, so i only had really good trips very few times and with no more than one pill.<BR>

The thing is, noticed after 3 or four weekends of doing ecstasy, that in the middle of the week, that is around wednesday usualy i woke up feeling so low, so bad i thought i could die right there. Imagine the worst day of your life, ok, now multiply it by two, that is how i felt. It usually lasted all day. I felt sad, cryied most of the day and everything lost meaning. Down down down. <BR>

By thursday i was already feeling better and by friday it was as if nothing had happened. But now i feel worn out, emotionally tired. I feel like i did too much too soon. It seems the more you take the deeper you fall.<BR>

Notice i only felt this way when taking high doses. After that i tried small doses (never more than one pill) and the after effects almost disappeared. Also notice that this year i abused acid as much as i could, almost every weekend for about 6 or 7 months. Then i turned to XTC. Sometimes doing both. Now i've decided to take a break since i feel my nervous system needs it.
