It was New Year eve and I had come home from college.  While I was gone, alot of friends got into the club scene and knew a club owner who was keeping the club open afterhours for people he knew.  After taking one at about 11:00, chewed the pill per a friends insturctions to get it going harder/faster - and it tastes like shit.  Imagine chewing asprin - just worse, and it was a hard taste to get rid of.  It took an hour to kick in, it was about midnight.  <BR>

It was like a sudden wave of feeling perfect.  I was sitting on these leather couches and all of a sudden I just felt completely open to everyone.  I got talkative, energetic, and suddenly interested in being touched.  I saw this girl with a little vibrating white bunny.  Completely unlike myself, I just go sit down with her and her friends, start taking to them, and talking her into massaging me and rubbing her bunny on my head and face.  Nothing could match the way I physically felt.  I was clear headed, but every sense was x10.  I could feel the bass, I was in a trance to the music, any completely touchy-feely.  I would have been completely content touching everyone and everything around me.  Normally, I am not a smooth person and have some difficulty interacting with complete strangers - that completely changed.  Suddenly, people who I didnt know, I could just feel at home with.<BR>

And being around friends- it was really moving.  After talking, about things that would never normally come up, I suddenly realized what true friends I had.  Things like, 'You know, I dont thing I ever told you but I...[miss you, thought of you, was worried about you, would have felt so bad if, etc].  After that night, I knew exactly who my true friends were - it was a startling discovery.  I always thought of them as friends, but never as the people who would take a bullet for me.  And it took that night for me to completely realize this.  And I was so excited and energetic after realizing this- that alone would have made my day.  But it was soo much better becuase of how I felt from the roll.<BR>

And I have never been a real dancer.  Cant keep beat - and I never danced in clubs out of fear of just being one of those people that you just laugh at and say, 'why is that person out there??'   Guess what, that changed too.  At one point in the night, I was dancing with my friends girlfriend in the middle of the dancefloor, dancing like it was my job.  Completely into the music, just flowing through me<BR>
<BR>
At 4:00AM, I took a second pill.  Picked me right back up.  Around 7:30AM, I started feeling a like I was going to puke.  We left at 8:00AM and at a stop light, I opened the door, puked, and was fine.<BR>
<BR>
I am a better person because of it.  Somehow, I just had a different outlook on things after that.  It may sound fake or stupid, but it was almost like how people who have near death experiences are changed and have a new outlook on life completely.  I felt like I knew so much more about myself after that.  Regrets : none.
