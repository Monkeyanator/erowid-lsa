I have taken E about 5 times, all one month resting period in between.  Also I am very sensitive to MDMA.<BR>
<BR>
The first time I took a half a pill: I experience no negitive effects. I rolled for about 3 hours. I felt only emotionally different no visuals.<BR>
<BR>
Second time I took one bunk pill and one good one(took at rave): Kicked in in an one hour and 15 minutes. This may have been cause the pill was H-BOMB<BR>
but i got a horrible panic attack 45 minutes into my roll I felt speedy, disoriented and i felt like i was going to die. After 25 minutes the panic attack stopped. I had horrible shaking all night long. Rolled for about another 6 hours and was very happy after the panic attack went away.<BR>
<BR>
Third time I barely rolled at all off of half otherwise no effect.<BR>
<BR>
Forth time and 5th time both one pill(one month apart): again panic attacks but not even close to how intense the first time was. (started after 20 minutes into my roll and lasted 10 minutes). Rolled for about 3-4 hours. Became extremely hot; enough that i didn't move around all night long.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
After effects from contiued use (after the 5th time): everytime i rolled i used 5-htp and vitaman C. i felt slightly depressed  more than i ever have before and its been 5 days and i don't think its going away for a while. also when coming down my 5th time i became desparate for another roll. This scared me cause it seems like addictive behavior. For the first time I crashed hard the next day, i felt like i didn't even exist. i had a problem with to much vics. since i rolled last i have a runny nose and a headache its feel like alergies but its from sniffing to much vics.  hopefully that will go away.<BR>

I have decided that i can't afford to continue the use of E, I need to stop now before i really screw myself over.  This is only from my personal experiences so take or leave whatever you got from this. My opinion is E is a one time use drug for me, it was good the first time but from then on its downhill.
