Never did I expect a trip like this!  I have eaten mushrooms before, 4 times, within the last 2 years.  But i have never really 'tripped' before.  I only felt giggly, warm inside.. that was about it.  But not this time.  I have had a high tolerance for mushrooms in the past, so i ate a lot more than normal. I wanted that 'trip feeling, the visuals everyone thinks is so great'.<BR>

     At first, i became very tired..very sleepy. When the time came for the visuals,i wasnt liking it,so i fought it. As my boyfriend started 'bugging', i saw something weird in his face, in his reaction, that sort of freaked me out, and i wasnt sure i wanted to see what he was seeing. <BR>

     After about 30 mins. to an hour, I felt very weak, very light headed.  I would try to sit up, from laying down on the bed, and my body would completely give out.  I couldnt stand up, as much as i tried to fight it, i wasnt feeling right.  I started to vomit, over and over again, hoping it would knock itself out of me.. little did i know, not until almost 8 hours later in the hospital, i would be alright.  I became completely paralyzed, immobile.  I was experiencing fainting spells, when i tried to move myself.  I was carried to the hospital, and like 1000 pounds dropped in a wheelchair.  About 10 mins of crying in the ER, they finally took me in.  I felt like i was on a heavy dose of anesthesia.. throughout my body, but the funny thing was, i was completely aware of what was going on.  Or should i say the freaky thing was, i was completely aware of what was going on.  They did some blood work, to see exactly what was running through my body, and heart test.. my heart wasnt beating strong.  After given poison absorbent, i started to get feeling back in my body. (6 hours later)  The Dr. said, my nerves and muscles were affected, not permanetly, but until the poison would leave my body. Quote of the Experience: 'I thought i was paralyzed for life.'
