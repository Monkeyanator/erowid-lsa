My suggestion to anyone who is considering taking a maiden voyage on shrooms, is to get some basic info on them first.  I had gone over to a buddy's home just to hang out.  My girlfriend and I were on very bad terms, and I decided that hanging out with the boys would help ease some tension.<BR>
<BR>
Unknown to me, they had purchases about 2g of shrooms for me to experiment with.  They were veteran users and assured me that it would be very pleasurable.  Before this, I had only been an occasional toker. So I tried it, along with a bunch of healthy hoots from my bong.<BR>
<BR>
I washed it down with a few beers and after half an hour nothing seemed to be happening, while all the while I hadn't noticed that I was getting full of energy.  <BR>
<BR>
The first signs came when I went to the washroom to take a piss.  I looked at myself in the mirror, and noticed my pupils enlarging and shrinking like flashing railroad crossing lights.  <BR>
<BR>
I went back into the living room where my two friends were waiting and told them what I saw.  My one friend handed me a picture of a motorcycle and asked me what I saw.  I noticed the traffic behind it in the picuture was moving at an incredible rate.  <BR>
<BR>
Bigger changes occured in the next couple of hours.  A black cat was sitting behind my one friend smoking a cigar for a few seconds at one point.  I was in the kitchen at another time watching popcorn be made with an air popper.  This was fun since the popcorn looked like a waterfall the way it was coming out and I began swimming around the kitchen.<BR>
<BR>
It turned ugly quick as I became violently angry with the one friend since he wasn't saying much to me.  I thought he was up to something and was planning my demise and was the cause of all the world's frustrations.  (Later I realized that this was a venting of the tension between my girlfriend and me).<BR>
<BR>
For most of the trip I was violent, however by reading articles and stories after the fact, I know how to influence the trip to be a more pleasurable one in the future.  Looking forward to it!
