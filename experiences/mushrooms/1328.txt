The first thing I remember was that I was in a very large kingdom in the sky.  I began to walk forward as if I was beginning a judgement. Then I came upon a large blinding light as if it was God. I was then judged for what I don't know. It seemed to take forever and I soon began to fall to what was earth. I was then confronted by a friend who was talking to me in a language I don't really understand. I was surrounded by hills and they were filled with poles of some sort. I was somehow broken away and began starting a conversation with a tree. It talked in the same language that my friend Corey was speaking, then it suddenly started to disintegrate and I was beginning to fall in a dark hole. I was told by my friend Keith that was when I woke up. It was 12:00 at night and there had been reports by the police for trespassing on private property (keep in mind that this last section was when I regained my ability to control myself)and that was all I remember... <BR>
