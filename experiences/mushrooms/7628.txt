It was a Friday after school and me and 4 friends scored on a half ounce of mush. So we each took around three and went to seven eleven to get some munchies after about a half an hour one of my friends was complaining about his stomach hurting I told him it was normal(i had done mush before he hadn't) so he calmed down and after a little bit began to feel okay. That's when it hit me. I had done mush before but only 1 gram maybe 1.5 so I wasn't ready for what happened. I was walking in this field and all of a sudden everything died and blossomed into the scene from gladiator where he's walking through the meadow and my mind felt like it was connected with nature and my self I felt as if I could do anything. Then my friend started tripping out at this squirrel that walked by and said it looked like his mom and we sat in the field and laughed then major open eyed visuals kicked in and everything was either blue, orange, yellow, or green . And little hippie flowers were floating around everywhere and I thought I was floating too. Then I stared into the clouds and so little stick mean Indians with spears do a very meaningful dance and I felt connected again with everybody and then I was in the meadow again where I stayed their living in a dream for the best 3 hours of my life.
