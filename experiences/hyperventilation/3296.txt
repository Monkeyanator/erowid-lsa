A rising shot for those who do not know, is when a person crouches down on the ground and starts hyperventilating. They then rise while getting a stinger. A person behind them holds them tight in a bear hug until the person passes out. I tried it and it was the trippiest experience ever. My entire body tingled and I just felt all this energy flowing through my body. My friend who did it before me, got up and started hugging people finally ending up on my lap with me craddeling him like a baby. The rising shot is a definite must for any smoking session.
