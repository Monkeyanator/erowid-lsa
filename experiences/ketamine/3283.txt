IV use of Ketamine<BR>
<BR>
I would say that I had my share of substances, from weed, ecstasy, acid, crystal meth, coke, etc. to regulated drugs like valiums, rivotrils, thorazines, dalmaines, xanors, and I guess a lot more and in so many combinations that I can no longer remember.  It was all for fun and trippin'...I like trippin'.  Going out of yourself and losing touch for a bit (to those who can relate, i'm sure this strikes a chord).  I'm not really fond of uppers...they seem to me like they're 'control substances'.  And that's the last thing I want, to feel like you have a grasp on life and then going down really paranoid.<BR>
<BR>
Then I tried Ketamine.  The first time I tried it was with ecstasy, in it's powdered form.  When I felt like I was going down from my e trip, I'd snort some.  It made going down a lot easier, sometimes even boosting up the peak again.  And then I snorted some by itself.  It was definitely a different trip.  Taking k with e was somehow an insult to the true hit of just k.  It was like nothing i've ever felt before.  I felt like i was outside of myself, looking at myself inside and out (figuratively).  I felt like I was in a world all my own, and that I was all alone but it was okay.  I had so many things to explore within myself...in my own mind.<BR>
<BR>
Then one night, my friend introduced me to a whole new way of taking k.  We took it intravenously.  First, some words of caution: this is a dangerous way of taking it, especially when you don't know what your doing and the people your with don't have a clue either.  Anyway, i trusted my friend.  My first dose was about 1 ml and then I was rocketed into space.  Makes me wonder where the hell they got the term 'shoot up'...hmmmm.  <BR>
<BR>
Anyway, it was definitely something else alright.  I was gone so fast I couldn't even remember the exact details of what happened.  Little details like when or how the needle was pulled out, when the belt was loosened...you know what I mean.  <BR>
<BR>
As for the trip, I felt like I was surfing on the rings of saturn and then shooting off to pluto.  It's not like other trips where in you feel like your brain dead.  Here, my mind was working so fast and so hard.  Then, deeper into the trip...I felt like I was one with the universe and that i was definitely connected to everyone and everything.  I realized that we, humans, animals, innanimate objects, plants and everything else, were all made of the same substance...energy!  I was at the vortex of time and space, and I could make things happen.  Realizing all of these things, I felt like i was getting closer and closer to the key to life as we know it.  It was like I have reached enlightenment.   <BR>
<BR>
Then, I felt like i was sliding down.  I was going faster and faster into an unkown abyss, but it wasn't scarry.  It just felt a bit weird because this wasn't just in my mind, I felt it all over my body.  It felt like it was actually happening to me physically.  Suddenly, I landed abruptly into my seat, and I was back in reality.<BR>
<BR>
When I thought about it, the experience really seemed like some sort of astral projection.  It all felt so real, that I was actually there in space...my 'being' in its pure energy form.  Especially with the slide back down, it really was like I dropped out of the sky and was vacuumed back into my body.  I realized so many things.  It was so easy to think, like some cosmic force pointing me to the right direction, pointing me to the truth.  That this really isn't the only form of existence.  Time is our barrier from leaping into the 4th dimension.  I literally saw time, moving linearly towards one direction, the future, in the middle of all that space.  It felt like such a limiting factor.  I was at the vortex, folding that line.  I could see the past, the present and the future.  And as i meshed these three together, time became space.  All that was left was my 'being'.  Not my spirit, not my soul, but the essence of me being a fact.<BR>
<BR>
The k trip really is on top of my list.  I honestly haven't tried everything, but that was definitely something!  If you are going to try it, please be very very careful, and make sure you are with experienced friends.  You will be gone (and i mean gone) for a while, so be with friends you trust.  And the act itself is dangerous.  It involves a syringe and the substance will be injected straight to your vein.  So please, be careful.  I'm just happy to share my experience, because of the things that I realized...not because I'm recommending that you shoot up.  Enjoy...
