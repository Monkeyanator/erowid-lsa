Loaded an unknown (~100mg) amount of ketamine into my vaporizor, which consists of a plasic base with a tube coming out one side and a hotplate on the top which a glass bubble fits over. as soon as it touched the hotplate it started to turn to a black liquid and give off thick white smoke.  i immediately put the bubble on and waited for it to fill.  The smoke tasted bad but went down relatively smoothly.  After 3 hits I started to feel the onset, so I stopped to observe the effects.  Much like snorted ketamine.  Took a few more hits and settled into the experience.  I very very briefly touched the k hole, but the effects didn't last long enough to stay there. <BR>

All in all, exactly like snorted ketamine, except the effects lasted all of 10min.  I'm interested in trying higher doses in the future, but am not too enthusiastic about it.  I doubt that this method lasts long enough to be really 'useful', but is good for a quick buzz..
