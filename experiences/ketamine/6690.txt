This in now way resembles any experience i have had with ketamine prior to this. I had 450-500mg of k last night in a pill at 11:30pm, orally, and about 20 minutes later i completely lost it, the world started moving and i faded away, but after that it was like a psychedelic rollercoaster, i could see familiar things in the room like my rope lights, the tv, i heard the tv, saw the pattern on my bed, the problem was i wasnt here in any way, i remember not being still at all, i was kicking around and moving and i could feel myself slam into the bed face first, kick the speakers by my feet, flop around responding to what was happening, and i could see fragments of what was happening.<BR>

But at the same time there was a psychedelic part to it, i was somehow inside some kind of continuum of death and reality, the hypercontinuum of consciousness, i felt like this was where we go after we have no body to hold on to, and i completely felt i had died. It occured to me that i had somehow been destroyed and my body and soul were becoming part of a reality we dont have access to, a place where the real reality is occuring, and i also now feel that life and reality do not exist physically at all, this is all a game of sorts. <BR>
<BR>
As this started to occur, i thought very strongly that this resembled my salvia trips in that reality was completely changing constantly according to what i did with my hands, although i wasnt in control of them. This cycle of realities imposing itself on me was never going to end. I felt calm in a way, but only emotionally and still i was almost to the point of losing it, what i felt most of the time was a desire to return to baseline as quick as possible, that something had control of me and i was moving under its control. <BR>
<BR>
Movements of my hands and body would bring an alternate path to another whole set of realities, i honestly dont even remember the whole experience, i am trying as best i can to recall it, but not everything is apparent. I feel as though i died and became part of real existance. I worried what would be thought of what i had done to myself by anyone who saw me like this, and i felt i had seriously changed something i couldnt fix. <BR>

After i apparently came down, around 5am, i was disoriented and dizzy to say the least, i vomited 3 times over the next 3 hours and then passed out. I woke up various times while sleeping and i remember dreaming extremely strange things, none of which i remember. I slowly woke up still returning back to normalcy around 2pm and i still dont feel the same, at the moment i am somewhat nervous and apprehensive, anxious, and fatigued. I dont think i will attempt that again just yet, at least until i can integrate what happened. I learned one thing to be sure, this world isnt real, and there is a complete sub existance all around us, i was part of it for a little while and it was too much to take in at the time, it certainly proves that we have some means of comunicating without speech, as none of this was known to me and i had not even a clue as to what it was like before hand.
