Well, I have never felt so distanced like this before.  <BR>
<BR>
The whole thing started when a friend sold me ~250mg of Ketamine HCl powder, and I decided that I would snort it.  I broke it into about 8 little tiny lines.  Hey, Ketamine isn't the most wonderful thing to put up your nose...  After I snorted about four (2 in each nostril) I was completely out of it.  All I could think about is what I was looking at.  <BR>
<BR>
This, being the first time I've ever done Ketamine, was very interesting... I went out into the hallway, after somehow snorting the other four lines, and was trying to go outside for a cigarette.  The hallway seemed to be miles long, and although I could feel my feet hitting the floor, I wasn't the one controlling them.  I couldn't feel my muscles move, I couldn't stop, turn left/right, or go faster, my body just got into a pattern of step, step, step, and kept going, but I don't know how.<BR>
<BR>
I came back up in the same manner, the steps in the stairway just kept comming, and my feet just kept climbing, but I didn't get tired after climbing 5 flights of stairs, nor did I feel anything.  I could hardly feel my body at all, and, seeing as it was cold out, couldn't think to put on a coat, but my T-shirt seemed to do the trick, because I wasn't cold either.<BR>

When I got back to the room, I layed down on my bed for a while, doing a small summersault into it (was that a good idea).  I say good, because the effects were tripled for a moment or two, I was lost in the K-Hole, but only for that little while.   When I got up, somewhere around an hour after snorting, I was almost normal, but not.  Right now, it feels like I am drunk, except that I have perfect control over my body, even if I still feel a little disconnected from it.<BR>
<BR>
Basically, I'm not sure Ketamine is worth it, but I can't really say either, because I wasn't in the hole for very long.  I never experienced any of the really interesting things reported by some users other than the out of body feeling, so I guess I may never even have been in the hole... interesting...<BR>

I think I might have to try it again, but only through experience in controlling myself did I manage to walk around and have no one think that I was completely out of it.
