I'll try and be as accurate as possible because my memory is a little fuzzy from that night.<BR>
<BR>
It was a friday night and there was a party at the house of a girl from my school.  A lot of people I knew were gonna be there so me and a friend of mine made our way there. As soon as we got to the party I started drinking and about 15 minutes after i got there i smoked a pretty fat blunt, so i was feeling nice.<BR>
<BR>
I spent a lot of time just getting shit faced and talking to people then me and 2 other friends went and egged some dumb ass kids house by that time i was pretty trashed and when we got back i drank a couple big glasses of vodka. I dont really remmeber anything after that up until i left the party wiht the buddy i came with.<BR>
<BR>
I dont remmeber the walk except when we walked through the park and i puked on my sweatshirt and pants and fell flat on my ass.  I hurt my hand and my elbow too somehow. the next thing i rmember is being in my bathroom then (i dont remember any of this, this is what my mom told me had happened) my mom found me on the floor passed out breathing irregularly. she tried to wake me up for a long time then went and got my dad and they carried me into bed. i geuss i threw up that night to cause the next morning my barf bowl was pretty full, even though i have no memory of puking except in the bathroom and in the park.<BR>

One thing i remember is my mom asking me if i was on mushrooms or any other drug and i laughed when she asked me. the day after i was sick all day even when i smoked a bunch of dank that night.
