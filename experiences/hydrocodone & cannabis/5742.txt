Recently, I was at my friends appartment with a few other people, one of which deals in pharmeceuticals.  I went there this day with the full expectation of being in a alterred state of consciousness because I have come to associate this place with a plethora of different substances, none of which I have ever experienced without first conducting thorough research.  She had Hydromorphone, Hydrocodone, Diazepam, Adderall, and a few others.  She offered me a 5mg tablet of the Hydrocodone which I readily accepted.  I popped the pill and then sat back and relaxed for a while, waiting for it to take effect.<BR>

     It was at some point during this that I remembered what my last experience was like with Hydrocodone.  It involved very unpleasant nausea and cramps which I did not care to repeat, even though my dose was smaller this time.  In an attempt ot try and prevent this situation, I began to smoke some high quality Cannabis out of my glass pipe because I read that it is an excellent anti-nauseant.  We smoked many pipes in succession until I was quite stoned, as were a few others in the room. <BR>

     Not only did I not have any nausea whatsoever, but the two substances had actually complemented each other very nicely.  I had completely forgotten about the hydrocodone I had taken, but now I realized that the wonderful, floaty feeling of the hydrocodone had taken the sometimes annoying body load away from the stoned feeling.  I felt wonderfully high for quite a while, seeming as light as a feather.  As far as the physical sensation, the closest feeliing I can compare it to is a mild Salvia experience without the visual side.   <BR>

     I am very experienced with cannabis, and I am no beginner with pharmeceuticals, but together, these substances are definitely very enjoyable.  I would be very interested in (cautiously) experimenting further.
