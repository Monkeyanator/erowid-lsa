It all began about 11:00 at night, I had just got back from Wal-Mart with my friend, we were ready to extract some hydrocodone. I had 14 10 milligram Watson hydrocodone pills. (Watson is a generic brand of pharmacueticals). If we had ate 7 a piece, we wouldve been f**ked for sure due to acetamineophen, so I extracted them using the extraction method described in the codeine FAQ.  It took about 2 hours to fully extract, but it was worth it.<BR>
<BR>
12:30<BR>
My friend and I take turns taking swigs of the solution, we get about 3 swigs a piece, I guess we got an even dose, I think we did anyway. I figured we lost some hydrocodone in the extraction, so I didn't know what was gonna happen.<BR>
<BR>
12:40<BR>
We smoke a bowl of marijuana out of a homemade bong. Then, I get out my glass pipe and we smoke 2 more bowls.<BR>
<BR>
12:55<BR>
I start spinning very fast, the buzz is like being very very drunk and floating at the same time. I am sure that I am going to puke, I run to the bathroom, but I don't puke and I feel better within seconds.<BR>
<BR>
1:10 <BR>
My friend and I walk upstairs to his room, I can't walk straight. I feel some nausea, so I lay down, we turn on Dark Side of the Mood by Pink Floyd and start to drift away. My friend chats on the computer most of the night<BR>
<BR>
Heres what the buzz is like:<BR>
Emmense physical and mental high. Feels like I am floating.<BR>
Some nausea, but I am laying down, and it goes away while I am.<BR>
Music is the greatest thing, I start drifting away to the cd and snap back into reality after a while.<BR>
It's very hard for me to keep my eyes open.<BR>
Euphoria is intense and great.<BR>
I have lost all track of time.<BR>
<BR>
3:00? (I am not sure cause time went so fast)<BR>
I suddenly feel like a hole has been torn in my buzz, I am still high as hell, but I figure that the weed has worn off.<BR>
So, I smoke 2 more bowls with my friend and lay back down, the weed replenishes my buzz and it's just as good as before.<BR>
<BR>
5:00<BR>
My friend hits the sack, both of us still high as hell, we probably didn't actually get to sleep until about 5:30, but I didn't want to sleep.<BR>
<BR>
7:00<BR>
We are woke up by my friends grandma, my friend is supposed to go somewhere, but he fakes sick and gets to stay home. We are both still very high, I try not to go back to sleep, but I do.<BR>
<BR>
11:00<BR>
I wake up with a slight hangover, nothing compared to a night of beer drinking though. I do not feel sick at all, just a bit hungry and very thirsty.<BR>
<BR>
I recommend hydrocodone to anyone, but extract it!<BR>
If you don't extract it, you are heading towards a night in the hospital.
