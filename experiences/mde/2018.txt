Okay, so we took some of what we were told was MDE, to mark the new year. We are mostly sure that it was in fact MDE, but it's difficult to be sure.<BR>
<BR>
12:27 am (T+ 0) - We threw down. The tablets were diamond-shaped, fairly small, with brown specks. We were expecting a chance to welcome the new year, and to get a chance to enjoy each other's company in our first on-on-one empathogenic experience.<BR>
<BR>
1:20 am (T+ :53) - 'Definitely coming up, feeling cold extremities, feeling like i want to stretch a lot.... kind of like a double latte'<BR>
<BR>
1:42 am (T+ 1:15) - Jittery, definitely on.<BR>
<BR>
2:15 am (T+ 1:48) - More in the basin, definitely E-ish, lit incense smells good, spool (by Jhno) sounds nice. Grooving.<BR>
<BR>
3:30 (T+ 3:03) Still feeling waves of new energy, not really coming down. A bit speedy, not that verbal. Why didn't my companion get an effect? Very strange. Very centered-ish, like I don't NEED to do anything, and yet the idea of slowly strolling around appeals.<BR>
<BR>
Later that night my companion decided to take a bath. Afterwards we retired to the bedroom, me still definitely on but coming over the peak. We lay awake in bed for at least two more hours before finally sleeping. <BR>
<BR>
Throughout the next day I felt low-power flashes of the same energy as the previous night. Coffee helped re-kindle those, as it does with MDMA.<BR>
<BR>
I felt throughout the entire experience a tightness in my neck and shoulder muscles. Not sore, but definitely tense. Even at +24 hours or so, they are still tight.<BR>
<BR>
The down side is not near as draining as mdma. I feel fairly good, though our discovery of a burglary at our house has dampened my spirits slightly. I feel as if this would be far worse had I been emotionally exposed by MDMA.<BR>
<BR>
This material is often described as more 'stoney' than MDMA, and with that I would agree. I spent most of my time just _zoning_ on a singular, Good feeling. I wasn't particularly chatty, though words came easily when I needed them. I was not WAY UP, but still felt clear, centered, and connected.
