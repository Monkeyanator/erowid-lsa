This is a report of the effects of 3-4g (inaccurate measurement) of Syrian Rue.  It was being tested to assure that no adverse reactions occured because of plans for a future Mimohuasca experiment.<BR>

The seeds were ground to a fine powder and swallowed after having fasted for about 18 hours.  About 45 minutes after ingestion, a sudden wave of very mild tingles was felt, and an increase in the level of 'static' in the visual field.  1.5 hours after ingestion, another wave of energy.  Equilibrium was quite off by this point.  Finally at 2 hours a cigarette was smoked, which induced vomiting almost immediately.  <BR>

A sort of general drunkeness was felt in the form of lack of coordination, and minor visuals, both closed and open eyed were apparent.  Thought was definitely altered as well.  The substance seemed to stimulate new thoughts and ideas and allowed for some interesting creative work later.  Also worked through a few things that had not been processed yet from past, stronger trips.  All in all this was a very mild experience, more on the level of a strong cannabis high than a psychedelic, but that was as much as I was expecting and it was definitely active at this level.
