One would hope that readers are familiar with the cautionary requirements of dicking around with ones <a href='http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/maois'>MOAI's</a> in combination with centrally active compounds.<BR>
<BR>
I've had my share of scare's... pumping veins and all. Personally I havn't found very many aplications for the betacarbolines that I continue to use aside from the traditional oral tryptamine (dmt, 5meo, dpt) huasca activation.  The one harmala combination that I have yet to try and would like too is mescaline. This combo makes sense, since a large amount of mescaline is usually required and it has been fairly widely reported as being a positive potentiation.  Combinations with mdma and other stimulating compounds seem quite ludicrous to me.<BR>
<BR>
The obscure rue combinations known to me are: <BR>
<BR>
with shrums: defintitely intense on the body at high dosage levels, qualitatively different trip.<BR>
<BR>
with 2cb: heard several negative reports, too much physical activation/headache<BR>
<BR>
with mescaline: many positives, a few neggies<BR>
<BR>
with LSD: several positive reports.  provides a more earthy grounded feeling.<BR>
<BR>
with DPT: works well huasca style, be very careful with the dosage. Comments from a friend: 'Instead of 100-200 mg oral only 30-80 are needed.<BR>
Also the oral DPT bodyload was greatly reduced.'<BR>
<BR>
with 5meODMT: increases effects, some report worrisome physical symptoms<BR>
<BR>
with Psilocybin: Many people report positive work with this, but can increase darkside and increase length, intensity, bodyload
