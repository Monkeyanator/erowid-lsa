Calea zacatechichi is a herb used by the Chontal Indians of Mexico to induce lucid dreams.  In websters dictionary Lucid is defind as clear to the understanding, and suffused with light.   <BR>

I prepared the Calea zacatechichi in the traditional way of the Chontal Indians, i measured approximately 1 gram of plant material into a glass pipe and another gram into a tea bag that i had emptied for a Calea z tea.   Then heated a cup and a half of water on the stove.   I light up the plant material in my pipe thinking that it might be harsh to inhale but to my surprise it was not but it was slitly bitter to taste.   After the bowl i prepared the tea. As it soaks, the dry leafs and flowers turned the water to a dark green and was very aromatic.   I slowly siped the tea and found it very bitter to taste and added a tablespoon of honey.  Prepared for bed and meditated for a few minutes and finished off the Calea z tea and fell asleep.<BR>

Most of my dreams are vary few and far between and those that i can remember are blurd and fragmented and never being of any importance.<BR>

In the morning i awoke from the truly LUCID dream.  The intensity of the feeling and emotions that i had felt my self and through others.   Colors bright, clear, enhanced and tectured.   Sound was gental and traumatic at the same time.   Taste and smell and all the sences are used.   This dream was meaningful and very real.   <BR>

This was my first experience with Calea zacatechichi and will try again with much more respect toward it.
