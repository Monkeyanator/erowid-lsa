I've mixed MDMA and syrian rue before on several occasions, taking the rue<BR>
either before or at the same time as the MDMA. I have also mixed Syrian rue with another phenethylamine, mescaline.<BR>
<BR>
Neither caused any problems at all (although when I mixed it with mescaline, I did end up puking, but that happens to me with rue most times anyway, and the mescaline+rue puking was much milder than any tryptamine+rue combination has ever caused). In the case of mixing it with MDMA, it was quite enjoyable and something I will undoubtedly do again. It produces a pretty strong potentiation and adds a new (and quite profound) earthy spiritual dimension to the experience.<BR>

The one caution is to use low doses of MDMA. In high enough doses, MDMA<BR>
itself can kill - as can most amphetamine derivatives. Taking MDMA with an<BR>
MAOI will lower the overdose threshhold since you are potentiating its<BR>
effects. If you choose to mix MDMA with Syrian rue, start with no more than half your usual dose of MDMA.
