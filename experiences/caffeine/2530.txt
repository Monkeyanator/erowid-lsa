I have been a coffee drinker for a long time, since I was twelve, and while I have never considered it an addiction, I will drink coffee continually if it is available. This came into play one night when I was hosting a movie at a local cinema. The movie was at midnight, and it was only 9PM and I was already feeling drowsy. I was with friends, and caffeine seemed like a good way to avoid falling asleep before the event. <BR>

I am not an entirely logical person, but what I did next still seems a bit strange. We didn't have anything other than a large tin of terrible nabob coffee, and we also didn't have any cones or filters. So I decided we would make coffee the old-fashioned way, that is, brew it with the water, then pour it through a strainer. My method for accomplishing this was fairly novel, as I simply took a fairly large pot, filled it with water, then dumped in 2-3 cups of coffee grounds. Then we let it cook for 20 minutes on a slow boil. It was terrible in taste, but I knew it had caffeine, so I drank 2 cups. Half an hour later I had lost control of my facial muscles, and it kept me up for the next 12 hours. It was interesting when I was there; I had a sort of elated feeling, like I was removed from the world, because I was operating on a different plane of reality. The next few days were terrible though. I don't know if it is just the amount of caffeine, or if we had some how cooked out some other chemicals, but for the next few days I was completely burnt out. It felt like I was hungry, but eating was hard, and my brain did not want to function at all. I still drink coffee, but not like this.
