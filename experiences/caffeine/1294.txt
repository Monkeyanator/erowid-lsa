my friend R brought some no-doz on the bus and they would be cool and he took 3 and me being the dick and showoff i am i had to take more so i maxed out at 5 boy big mistake, at first it was cool but i looked like i was really sick i mean i was shaking so bad oh and this is the first time that (besides an occasional coke) caffine has been introduced to this body no coffee nothing. but in forst period i was just sitting there shaking like i was sick i mean shaking sooooo bad like i was faking it , that bad well anyway back to the story i started to feel sick to my stomach so i lied down and tried to nap but found it impossible so i asked my teacher if i could go to the bathroom just to get out and regroup myself , as i got up i started to shake and flop around like kramer does all the time in seinfeld. then went to the bathroom where i puked my guts out.<br>

i mean i have never done it that much i have no idea where everything came from, empty stomach but still after about 3 good heaves i started having dry heaves until i almost passed out. and i still felt like shit after that and i felt like shit till about 5th period . well anyway i would not recommend taking caffine pills they sure as hell didnt agree with my stomach.
