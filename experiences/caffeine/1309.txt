Dont let anyone tell you caffeine is mild. <BR>

The night before my pysch paper was due, i sat down to write the godammned 100+ pages. well one night aint gonna cut it, so i downed a two liter of coke while typing furiously on my laptop. i stayed up all night, and at around 7am, i leave the comp to get ready for school the paper is due in 12-13 hours. i swallow two cups of coffee before leaving, and swallow two vivarin tabs along with a red bull on my way out the door. at the campus, skipping all classes, i sit in the lounge, trying to type the damn thing. my eyes are frozen in the wide eyed position, hands cant seem to stop doing the jitterbug. i couldnt even hit the keys on my laptop, they were shaking so bad. <BR>

i had to finally get my b/f to type it out for me. my heart was pumping the mad dash, my breathing was furiously fast, and incredibly shallow. i couldnt get enough air into my lungs fast enough. my brain was doing shit things, instead of thinking of my psych paper, i had made a discovery in the field of physics, (it had to do with changing the state of matter: solid, liquid, gas, to accomodate human travel through electrical sockets...dont ask!) and come 9pm, when the paper is due, i throw it at the prof, sprint to my car, and try to drive home. im sick, my stomach feels like i just swallowed liquid plumr, and i nearly caused two wrecks on my way home. <BR>

i get home, and crashed. slept for almost two days straight. caffeine gives you a great feeling, but not that much. my advice. if u have a paper due, dont do it the nite b4. and dont drive home under the influence.
