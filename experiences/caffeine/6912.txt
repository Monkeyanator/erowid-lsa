I decided to try caffiene to help me study.  I did'nt realize I could become dependent upon it so quickly.  I would take 2 to 3 tabs of caffiene (400-600mg) in the morning to help me stay focused during my Algebra class.  This worked for about 2 weeks and then my tolerance started to build up.  I began to crash before my math class.  This started to worry me, for I now depended upon caffiene to get me through the class.  I started to take more and more util my tolerance had reached a very high level (1000 to 1200 mg to get the desired effect).<BR>

Well after this coming up and then coming down I was beginning to realize I was really addicted.  I decided to quit using caffiene for a week.  I expected no or slight cravings.  Oh shit....I didnt think that I would crave this much...I cant take it ... I feel so drowsy all of the time.  I feel as if I cant do near the stuff I could do on caffiene.  I guess I can get through another few days...just so I can get that great buzz I got the first or second time I did caffiene <BR>

Oh, yeah and I learned not to take so much caffiene that you cant handle it... I'm still gettin' over this bitch!<BR>

Beside all the negative stuff, caffiene can be a good thing to use.. if you take caution ... Just be reasonable with the dosage... just have a good time
