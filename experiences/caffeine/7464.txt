I was at a local town event where people could freely spend the night at the high school football field. I was getting tired around 7 PM for some reason, and I was pissed. If I wanted to be out all night, I couldn't get tired now!<BR>
<BR>
Me and my friend, who was also feeling tired, walked up to a local 7-11. I went inside and bought a drink called 'BOMBA'. It was a bottle shaped like a grenade. It gave the ammount of caffeine on the side, but you needed to convert it, and I was too lazy. So I bought 2 and chugged them both.<BR>
<BR>
By time we had walked back we were both feeling more awake, and I a little hyper (I expected that...). We sat down and talked with some friends for an hour or so. Then I went to stand up...<BR>
<BR>
As soon as I got to my feet, I felt unbelievably stoned. I fell right over. I then stood back up and attempted to walk. I had to keep grabbing on to things. I was frightened cuz I had no idea why this was happening. I walked a little bit more and tripped.<BR>
<BR>
My friend, who had drank 2 as well came up to me and asked if I was alright. I told him I wasnt sure. He wasnt experiencing anything. I was so confused as to why I was.<BR>
<BR>
This lasted about an hour. I was stumbling around, being laughed at, but I didn't care. After I realized what was happening (although I didn't know why) I was cool with it, and just walked it off I guess.
