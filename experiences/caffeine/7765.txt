Now I can't remember all that clearly why the hell I did it in the first place but back in high school my girlfriend and I were having a party and I was running on no sleep so in a fit of fleeting stupidity I walked up to the drug store and bought a box of no doze (20 100mg pills)....and downed them all with a few chugs of jolt.  When it first kicked in I was wired......talking so fast i slurred my words and laughing insanely then about an hour in I crashed HARD with a pounding persistent headache tripped out vision and I couldn't stand without help.  I fianlly got home about 4 hours after I took the stuff......puked steadily for about a day and swore off caffiene pills for life <BR>
