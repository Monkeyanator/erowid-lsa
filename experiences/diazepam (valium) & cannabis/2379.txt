Pill Description<BR>
----------------<BR>
8mm round powder-blue pill. One side, stylized R. Other side, scored.<BR>
Above score, '053'. Purported to be diazepam. Owing to the blue color, I<BR>
guess that it is probably 10mg, as this is the color scheme that<BR>
non-generic Valium uses. [Erowid Note : According to the Drug Identification Bible, this is a generic 10mg diazepam pill produced by Purepac Pharmaceutical]<BR>
<BR>
1:50AM<BR>
------<BR>
I ingest the pill. We had a snowstorm today, and I had ingested some DPT<BR>
earlier in the evening to go play in the foot deep snow (the first real<BR>
snowstorm in over 3 years), but it has long since worn off. I also smoked<BR>
a little pot earlier, but it has mostly worn off as well. I am more or<BR>
less at baseline.<BR>
<BR>
2:20AM<BR>
------<BR>
I begin to feel a little different. It's been a long time since I've had<BR>
any benzodiazepines, but this does feel like what I remember. The main<BR>
distinctions between the various benzodiazepines are in duration and<BR>
intensity. Qualitatively they are all more or less the same. As far as<BR>
comparison to other depressants, it is most similar to GHB, but definitely<BR>
not the same. It's even less similar to alcohol, and only vaguely similar <BR>
to the narcotics. I will base most of my comparisons on GHB, that being<BR>
the depressant I'm most familiar with. Diazepam is supposed to take about<BR>
an hour to reach peak effect, so it's still too early to really describe<BR>
it, or compare it to anything else. Initially, it seems as if there is<BR>
more of a calming effect, but less of a euphoric effect than GHB. The<BR>
physical sensations are somewhat different as well. There is more of a<BR>
feeling of muscle relaxation than GHB produces, and the ecstasy-like <BR>
tactile enhancements of GHB are pretty much absent from the diazepam<BR>
experience. The come-on is alot more gradual. I'm at T+0:30 now, and its <BR>
just beginning to take effect. I'll give it some more time.<BR>
<BR>
2:50AM<BR>
------<BR>
Well, I'm now at T+1:00, and I'm feeling the diazepam pretty well... tho<BR>
from what I've read, it can take from 1-2 hours for peak plasma levels.<BR>
And I didn't have an empty stomach, so I'm sure I haven't reached the peak<BR>
effect yet. I can feel it gradually increasing still, in fact. I'm a good<BR>
deal more intoxicated than I was a half hour ago, but alot of my original<BR>
assessments hold. Compared to GHB, this is a milder intoxication, in some<BR>
ways. The muscle relaxation is alot stronger than with GHB. The sensation<BR>
is similar to having just stepped out of a hot bath or sauna - totally<BR>
relaxed muscles, a jello-like body feeling. There is much more of an urge<BR>
to close the eyes than I get on GHB, though I don't feel sleepy at all.<BR>
As I said earlier, this is much more of a calming, relaxing feel than the<BR>
euphoric high of GHB. There is a touch of the strobe-like dizzy visual<BR>
effect that I sometimes get from high doses of GHB, but it is much more<BR>
subdued. I am listening to music through headphones... diazepam seems much<BR>
more conducive to music appreciation than GHB. I keep getting drawn to lie<BR>
down and just relax and absorb the music.<BR>
<BR>
3:10AM<BR>
------<BR>
I'm at T+1:20 now. I think I've hit the peak effects. Diazepam seems to be<BR>
more of a dumbing high than GHB... I find myself closing my eyes and just<BR>
listening to music and and feeling the physical sensations, there is alot<BR>
less noise in my mind than usual. Less thoughts flying back and forth.<BR>
This is much more noticable than on GHB. I am feel as if sleep would be<BR>
easy and pleasant at this point, but its not the irresistable passing out<BR>
that GHB can cause. Putting on some more uptempo music dramatically<BR>
increases my energy level, and vanquishes all thoughts of sleep. I feel<BR>
very mellow and relaxed. I have a pleasant body high which is similar to<BR>
GHB, yet distinct. More relaxed, less tingly. When I get up to walk<BR>
around, I stagger a little... unlike alcohol and GHB though, this stagger<BR>
doesn't seem to be due to dizziness or a loss of equilibrium, but rather<BR>
due to the fact that my leg muscles are very relaxed, and my legs feel a<BR>
little jello-like, sort of like if I had excersized them a great deal<BR>
earlier. My whole body in fact is sort of slumped and very relaxed. None<BR>
of my muscles seem to have any tension.<BR>
<BR>
3:25AM<BR>
------<BR>
Still about the same place, but I feel myself yawning a little now. Not<BR>
really tired at all though. I decide to smoke some marijuana at 3:35, or<BR>
T+1:45.<BR>
<BR>
3:35AM<BR>
------<BR>
I went outside and filled a juice glass full of loose snow. I spooned this<BR>
snow into my bong, and loaded a hit into the bowl. I take a hit... the icy<BR>
cold condensed smoke goes down smoothly and expands in my lungs.<BR>
Immediately I feel a significant boost in the effects of the diazepam...<BR>
though it has changed slightly from the THC now in my system. Considering<BR>
the date and realizing that this snow storm is probably my last<BR>
opportunity to take snow-bongs at least until next winter, I load another<BR>
hit and suck it down. I cough pretty hard... Well, one more just for good<BR>
luck! I feel pretty high now... I'll give it a few minutes to settle in,<BR>
then describe it.<BR>
<BR>
3:50AM<BR>
------<BR>
T+2:00 and feelin' groovy! I predominantly feel diazepam, but its now<BR>
strongly colored by the pot. The mild shaky visual effect I noticed<BR>
earlier is now noticably stronger, approaching the levels I'd expect from<BR>
alcohol... I *feel* much more lucid than I would on GHB or alcohol...  But<BR>
this is illusion. I'm clear headed, but *too* clear headed. There are far<BR>
fewer verbal thoughts running through my mind than normal. But there is no<BR>
feeling of confusion or disorientation. It is not a loss of coherence,<BR>
just a drastic slowing of pace.<BR>
<BR>
4:20AM<BR>
------<BR>
I take a puff, of course... I still feel about the same, and I think this<BR>
report can be wound up now. It's T+2:30. Thinking about the diazepam and<BR>
how the night has gone, it looks like its two primary actions seem to be<BR>
as an anxiolytic and a muscle relaxer. There is a mild euphoria, but alot<BR>
less than from GHB or alcohol - its more a feeling of relaxation than<BR>
anything else. Granted I am alone right now, but this still feels much<BR>
less of a social drug than GHB or alcohol, too - this is something I'd<BR>
like to take by myself and lay in a hammock or on the beach. Not a party<BR>
drug. I've enjoyed benzodiazepines every time I've done them, and find<BR>
them far superior to alcohol. They're not something I enjoy enough to<BR>
seek them out, but they're a nice treat when they come into my hands. I'm<BR>
sure I will sleep well tonight!
