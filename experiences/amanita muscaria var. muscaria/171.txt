My first experience with the Amanita muscaria mushroom was a really intense trip of the body and mind.  From the experience reports I had read, I wasn't expecting that much from this curious little mushroom, but I ended up getting more that I bargained for.  My two friends and I ordered some grade A+ mushrooms from the internet, and we received them a week later.  We ate the shrooms with salsa at 8pm one evening, and by 9pm we were feeling some of the effects.  There was a little nausea to begin with, but it subsided within 10 minutes, and a feeling of energy surged through my body.  <BR>

I walked into another room to smoke some pot, and it felt like I was walking on air.  I only took one hit, because I was feeling so good from the shrooms that I didn't need anything else.  I started to notice some definite alterations in perception.  I sat down with my fellow trippers to listen to some music.  While we were listening my friend pointed out to me that the patterns on the carpet were moving.  I looked down and I noticed it also.  By now, we were experiencing some really cool visuals.  The music seemed to make the room come alive.  Shapes and colors were dancing throughout.  I layed down and noticed that the ceiling was dripping with a clear blue substance.  I tried not to be hit with the drops as I lay on my bed.  My friend asked me whether or not I saw the waterfall running across the ceiling that he saw.  I told him what I was seeing, and that was the last conversation that we had for awhile.  <BR>

I let my mind take over, and I experienced one of the most intense psychological trips that I can remember.  It was like I was trapped in a series of dreams and every time I tried to come out of one, I would only get trapped in another.  They kept multiplying, and after awhile, I was trapped in thousands of dreams and I got the feeling that I may never wake up.  This fear subsided though, and I realized that I was just tripping.  That was the thing about these mushrooms, no matter how lost in your own world you got, you still always knew that it was just a trip and that it would end sometime.  I think that was the only thought that kept me from flipping out.  <BR>

Eventually, the drug started to wear off after about 5 hours.  It was 3am and I started to regain control of my thoughts.  I went to sleep, and I had some dreams that seemed eerily realistic.  I would recommend these mushrooms to everyone.  It was a really interesting experience that left me humbled by the power of one's own mind.
