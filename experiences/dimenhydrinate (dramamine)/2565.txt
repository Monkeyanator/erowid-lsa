I had taken Dramamine 4 other times before but never did I feel the way i did this 4th of July. Me and my cousins were sitting in the park smoking some pot where we were going to watch the fireworks. My cousin then offered me and her sister some Dramamine I took 20 and they each took 12. About 45 min. after I had started to feel the effects kickin in. I layed down on the grass and started dosing off and waking up over and over until i finally got up and walked around a little bit. After I had mellowed out I sat back down on the grass and started talking to my cousins but mid-sentence I would forget what I was sayin and just stop talking. I was also having a really hard time understanding what people were saying they would have to repeat themselves several times before I actually heard them. I then started seeing things starting to twitch. objects would jerk back and forth over and over. <BR>

At that time I was barely able to stand and my mouth just kinda hung open like I was unable to control my jaw. Then the fireworks started (they looked cool as fuck). Afterwards we went back to my cousin's house where we started lighting off or own fireworks. I was so stupid at that point I tried lighting off fireworks that had already been done. Well I decided at that point I had had enough and tried to go to bed but while I was laying in the bed everything in the room started moving and twitchin all over the place and I was hearing things that weren't there. After about a half hour of trippin in the room I finally dosed off and woke up the next morning feelin stupider then ever. <BR>

Well thats my story. <BR>
