I had read a couple postings about experiences with the Big Laughing Gym mushroom, Gymnopilus spectabilis.  So I ordered some from JLF.  On New Years Eve around 11pm, I took 3g of crushed, encapsulated Syrian Rue seed.  About 15 minutes later I ate the mushrooms in beef soup.  This experience was very mild.  After ~2 hours, I was feeling unreal, awkward.  Then a fight broke out at the party I was at, and the rest of the night, all I felt were bad vibes.  But it wasn't too bad because the shrooms were REALLY weak.  If they would have been strong I probably would have freaked.  Everything that I've ever bought from JLF has failed to produce results.  They say 'no guarantees,' and I see why.  I'm done buying from them.
