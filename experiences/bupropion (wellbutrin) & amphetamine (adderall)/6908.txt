About a few months back, I was bumping a lot of Adderall, mostly to stay awake and party, or to do work. Occasionally I would have about 20mg before a class to get the wave of lucidity and heightened sexuality that it gives me for a very short period of time. (Math shouldn't have to be boring.)<BR>

	On this particular day, the person who I get my Adderall from had 100 mg pills of Wellbutrin. I had heard of Wellbutrin before, and knew only that it was an anti-depressant. I decided to test it out, at first on a lower level dose considering i didn't know how strong it was or anything. So I bumped about 25 mg of it, followed by 20 mg of adderall. The taste going into my nose was pasty and nauseating, and when the drip hit, it was horrible. It tasted like bitter paper machee was attacking my throat. After about half an hour, a shiver similar to a chill slowed over me. It was really tingly, but only lasted literally three minutes. I was so far disappointed.<BR>

	Not wanting to snort it again, I mixed the other 75 mg of Wellbutrin with another 10 mg of Adderall inside a carbonated beverage, and drank the results. (I find this works with most perscriptions.) There was an almost immediate effect. It must have been the combination of the two doses. I felt a very light feeling when i walked, and there were some blurry spots of vision. I had a heightened sense of elation and lightness. Almost as if I was in the time between awake and asleep, but still very conscious. After a while however, I began to feel dizzy, and there was a little motion sickness, but that's it.<BR>

	This happy tiredness continued well on into the day.
