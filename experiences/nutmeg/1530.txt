New Year's Eve 1999<BR>
I thought I'd try something different for such an important night.  I took 3 or four whole nutmeg nuts, ground them up in a cheesegrater, put the powder in a glass of water and drank it.  It was pretty gross, but I choked it down.  I took it at 2 in the afternoon.  I did this because I was planning on leaving to go to a party at 8:00 and I heard it takes 6 hours to kick in.  Good timing.  At around 8:00, before I left, I was watching a movie in my living room with my brother and his girlfriend.  It kicked in really fast.  My legs went really numb, like I'd been riding a bike for a long time.  I broke out laughing and couldn't stop.  I got up and looked around.  When I moved my head, I didn't see the room move, it was more like a series of still shots--hard to describe.  So anyway, I walked to the party.  When I got there, I had about 1/2 a bottle of wine and that's it.  The wine tasted really bad because of the nutmeg.  Everyone was partying and I felt really anti-social.  My girlfriend came in late and when I saw her I didn't really feel too excited to see her.  I heard the song 'Re-arranged' by Limp Bizkit and it sounded WAY better while on nutmeg.  I could hear every layer of music, every instrument.  I looked really stoned...red eyes, sluggish and generally wasted.  <BR>

I don't remember much after the clock struck twelve.  One thing I do remember is sitting on a couch and my girlfriend came up to me and just touched my shoulder.  It felt like she grabbed my shoulder and spun me around.  I freaked out and she tells me that I was really frightening...it looked like I was gonna smack her or something (but of course I didn't and had no intention of doing so.) Man, I was hallucinating.  I fell asleep not much later.  The next morning I felt like shit (like I was hung over) and I spent the day sleeping.
