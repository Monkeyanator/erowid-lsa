Ok, I'm gonna make this short.  Nutmeg, is something that one could never be addicted to. The only good use I have found for it is that if you smoke with it, you can feel heavily stoned the next day, therefore, saving some money. <BR>

One day me and my friend were waiting for 2 other friends to bring us some bud. We were waiting near a Shop n' Bag, and I heard about using nutmeg as a narcotic so I figured, 'what the hell.' I went in and looked in the spices section and found a small 31 gram bottle of nutmeg. It was $4 so I said fuck it and stuck it in my pocket. Then we went out and I took the whole bottle of nutmeg down with Yoo-Hoo.  I felt small effects here and there, then I smoked 6 gravity bong hits of Kind Bud. After that I didn't feel the nutmeg anymore (probably cause I was HIGH). The next morning I woke at 6am for school. My eyes were shut and glazed. I went into school feeling extremely relaxed and real nice. All in all I think I would do it again.<BR>

I have also smoked nutmeg before.  I took about 15 hits of it out of a bubbler. With the bud I had smoked earlier, it gave me a feeling of being high on angel dust. Unfortunately, I didn't feel any relaxation, or any sort of euphoria at all. Taking it orally is better.
