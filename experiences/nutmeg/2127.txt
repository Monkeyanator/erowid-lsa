I've tried nutmeg once, years ago. Clueless as to how much my friend and I took, but we tried it with everything; water, milk, soda, straight, and it tastes like shit no matter how you take it. Afterward...nothing. The night went by and nothing happened. However, when I woke up in the morning, the walls were breathing for several minutes. My friend reported spider webs covering the floor of the classroom he was in. Other than that...nothing.<BR>

My two cents...it's not worth it.
