I tried Nutmeg about two years ago, shortly after obtaining my copy of the Psychedelics Encyclopedia. It was a weekend, so there was no worry about being messed up for work the next day. I sat down and swallowed two large spoonfuls of ground nutmeg. I have since read other articles here, and people suggest mixing it with something like chocolate or milk.....take their advice. trying nutmeg straight is like swallowing a mouthful of bleach soaked saltine crackers....you can't produce any saliva, and it tastes like chemicals.<BR>

I felt no effects for quite some time. I remember thinking that this was a bogus drug. and then it hit. I had a pretty harsh case of tinnitus (ringing of the ears), my vision was a little out of focus, and my concentration was for shit. not pleasant in any way. My only hope was the ride would be over soon. It wasn't.<BR>

I finally got to sleep about 10 hours later (about 8 hours after laying down to TRY to sleep it off). for the next two days I felt nausea and headaches wrack my body. eventually, by late in the second day of hangover, I was feeling well enough to eat and I finally slept deeply enough to feel rested.<BR>

nutmeg is not something I will try again in the future, unless I WANT to feel the worst hangover in my life repeated again and again.
