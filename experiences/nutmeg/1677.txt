After hearing rumors that nutmeg could be used as a mild hallucinagine, a friend and I decided to try it one night.  We talked on the phone and he said he would come over in a couple hours.  To pass the time, I decided to look some stuff up on the net about nutmeg and what it does.  I had read some funky shit describing what it was like to be on a 'nutmeg high.'  It was supposed to be some great stuff.  I told me friend about this and we decided to try it as soon as he got over.  We each took around 16 grams in hot water.  First off, it smelled like shit.  Second, it looked like shit.  Third, it tasted like shit!!  <BR>

It was honestly one of the most butt-nasty things I had ever voluntarily eaten.  After suffering through the crap, we waited for it to take effect.  We went on a walk and were feeling fine.  The only problem we were having was our stomachs were a bit queezy, but we anticipated that and didn't eat too muhc before taking it.  When we gt back to my house, we sat around and watched a movie.  The only thing that happened was that our stomachs continued to feel shitty and in fact, worsened.  Eventually, it became so bad that we both threw all that sht back up.  It was horrible.  It was worth a try, but didn't come through.
