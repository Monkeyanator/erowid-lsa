i had been reading/hearing about the effects of nutmeg for a long time, so when i moved into this new place i decided to have a little party on my own and bought 35gm of the ground nut. it was about 4pm when i took half of it in a glass of water (tasted shitty but not impossible to swallow). waited for about one hour but didn't feel any significant effect apart from a light buzz, as if i'd just had a pint or two of lager, so i decided to take the rest of it. a few minutes later i felt like taking a nap (i was up since 7 in the morning, which is fucking early for me, so i didn't think it was the nutmeg kicking in). when i woke up at about 9pm i felt really sick and tired. i made some pasta and as i finished eating it i became aware of the effect. it was a bit like pot but i felt generally more energetic and there wasn't any of the branched way of thinking that pot gives you. i listened to some happy/funky music for some time. there was definitely some kind of sound distortion going on because, even though the cd wasn't even that good, i still remember dancing, jumping and laughing alone in my room, like a complete nutter. i don't know how long that went on for, it could've been 20 minutes or two hours later when i realized i was also having visual hallucinations (quite pleasant actually). <BR>

jimi started coming out of the poster in the wall and smile at me. but at one point things started to turn really nasty, paranoia started kicking in and i found it really hard to control myself. i was walking up and down the house thinking i had completely lost it, that it wasn't the nutmeg that was making me trip but that i had actually gone mad. i tried to sleep but couldn't, instead went into this kind of delirious nightmarish state where i didn't know whether i was dreaming or awake, as if sounds and images from my head were materializing inside the room throughout the night.<BR>

when i came around at about 5am i was still hallucinating, the ceiling was completely covered in twisting, black and white mandalas. my eyes were still bloodshot red and my mouth and throat were dry as never before. i felt really sick and threw up some black and green stuff which at the time i thougth were bits of my liver. i had a really bad hangover for the rest of the day and still felt a bit slow/dumb for a few days after. about two weeks later i decided to take nutmeg again, this time i took only about 15 to 20gm and i didn't feel much apart from a lighter version of the delirious sleep and a hangover which was just as nasty as the first one. <BR>
even after a few months from that time i still had some weird kind of flashback experiences (especially after a few spliffs), which weren't pleasant but were not particularly bad. i wouldn't recommend nutmeg as a recreational drug, it is a nasty experience overall and not very healthy. but if you don't give a fuck and want to try it anyway, do not underestimate it.
