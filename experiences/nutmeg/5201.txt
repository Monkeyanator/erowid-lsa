I have tried Nutmeg a few times and each time, because of setting, other hallucinogens, time, and dosage, each experience has been very different.  <BR>
<BR>
The first time I tried it, I had taken two pills of MDMA and remembered reading about nutmeg.  I figured that snorting the nutmeg might help it work faster than what I had read.  Because of the MDMA, I didn't feel too many effects and saw mild trails, but the effects were MUCH faster than ingestion.<BR>
<BR>
The second time I tried nutmeg was when I decided to eat the recommended amount.  I did it around 8:00 PM and felt nearly no effects.  The next day, however, I woke up feeling as if I was glued to my bed.  I had been asleep for about 10 hours and was coming down off of the peak.  I was seeing movement on my walls and felt like my bed was trying to swallow me.  No negative effects other than mind dizziness.<BR>
<BR>
The third time I tried nutmeg, I had been drinking and was at the point of being drunk.  Forgetting that it is a CNS depressant, I put about 5 lines up my nose and puked.  I felt like I couldn't move for the rest of the night.  DO NOT MIX NUTMEG WITH ALCOHOL OR ANY OTHER DEPRESSANT!!  <BR>
<BR>
The fourth time I finally got it right.  I ingested about 3 tsp. (approx 15 grams) at around 4:00 PM.  I didn't feel any effects until around 8:00, when I got a slight buzz and a lot of energy.  Along with this, I felt a pain in my arms (something that happens to me on mushrooms as well).  I remember having to use some rubber cement for a project and thinking that the cement was what was affecting me, not the nutmeg.  Around 10:00 or 11:00, I went to the bathroom and looked at my eyes.  They were VERY red.  My mouth was very dry and I was feeling like I had been awake for days.  I went back to my room and watched a movie in complete darkness.  I was concentrating heavily on the movie and remember feeling as if everything but the TV screen was existing inside of a void or another dimension.  I went to bed around 3:00, still feeling strong effects.  The next day, I kind of had a hard time waking up, and my thoughts were somewhat blurred, but this might have been my lack of sleep the night before.  <BR>

<!--I plan on attempting a nutmeg experience again, possibly snorting it without any other drugs in my system, or ingestion early in the day - around 11:00 AM or so. Based on my previous experiences, I do recommend nutmeg for the curious - just be sure not to drink or use any painkillers or sedatives.  Also, be sure and take it at least 6 hours prior to the actual planned experience and plan on it lasting for at least another 6.  The next day won't be very easy either.  <BR>

Finally, experiment with it.  Figure out the best way to do it for you.  Nutmeg can be very interesting.-->
