A few months ago, going on a friend's good report, I did the most desperate thing left to do for a druggie low on his or her cash. I snorted up nutmeg. Ground nutmeg, of course. For the first few moments, specifically an hour, I felt absolutely nothing besides a terrible burning sensation in my nose that refused to back down. A lot of reddish brown tissue came out of that night (gross, I know!). Though after an hour and a half passed by, I did actually sense a slight body buzz, and maybe a bit light headedness. However, I thoroughly do NOT recommend one to snort nutmeg. The incessent nasal irritation was more than enough motivation for me to steer clear of it from now on.
