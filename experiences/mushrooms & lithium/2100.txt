During my last summer break, 1999, a friend and I ran into a very large quantity of 'Cow-Pie' psilocybe mushrooms; they were only $120/oz., so we figured we could make a fair amount of money if we made a large purchase. During our first meeting with the supplier, we bought 6 ounces and began to sell our product to some of our other friends. We indulged ourselves in this abundance of fungus, tripping on the weekends, and sometimes during the weekdays.<BR>
<BR>
Following some harrowing experiences with the judicial system earlier in the year, a psychiatrist prescribed me a medication called Eskalith to 'balance my moods.' Eskalith is an antidepressent/anti-manic pill, more commonly known as Lithium. I was taking 150 mg. each morning for about 3 months before we got a hold of the moushrooms.<BR>
<BR>
I tripped on a number of occasions during this whole bout, on dosages moving up into the 9 gram mark, and had nothing but beautiful and thouroughly enjoyable experiences. One weekend, I was at home alone, and decided to eat a little over an eighth of an ounce for a quick joyride away from boredom. When I began to experience the first signs of tripping, I called my (buyer) friend up, and had him come get me so I could enjoy the trip with someone else. We went to talk to another friend and eat with him at his resteraunt for about an hour and a half, and still I had experienced no trouble.<BR>
<BR>
At the end of the meal, though, I began to notice a nervous twitching, and as it grew in intensity, a began to blackout for tiny fractions of a second at a time. I was gripped by the fear of the inevitable bad trip, although I had never had one, having tripped nearly forty times before then. I insisted that we go outside and leave, but as I got into the car, everything began spinning, and I threw up everything I had eaten. I was plagued by incessent fears that I cannot explain; all-out claustrophobia even though I was outside, being sure that death was inevitable.<BR>
<BR>
My friend had no idea what to do, so he started driving me to a more experienced, older companion; this just made it worse though, for the quick, continuous movement of the car made me sicker. I was unable to talk, so was therefore unable to tell him to stop, and continued throwing up what little substance I had left in my stomach.<BR>
<BR>
Halfway through the drive, I blacked-out completely, and cannot remember anthing up until when I woke up, propped up in my older friends hands above the toilet, gagging my guts out. When I was through being sick, he helped me get clean, and I went to sleep in his bed for about 2 hours. When I woke up later, I felt completely refreshed and I went home to rest and contemplete this horrid experience.<BR>
<BR>
When I later talked with my two friends, they explained that while I was out, I went into a phase of convulsion-like movement, with my eyes rolled back into my head. I'm glad I don't remember any of this, for what I do remember is, without a doubt, the scariest moments of my life, ever.<BR>

If ANYONE has ANY information about my reaction to this unlikely (at least, unbeknownst to me) reaction to the combination, I would be ecstatic to recieve your comments or advice. My e-mail is d_y_s_f_u_n_k_t@hotmail.com.
