My first experience, and only one to date, was one to remember - or in my case - not really remember. I happened to be taking a large amount of medications: 60mg of Prozac (antidepressant), 40mg of Celexa (antidepressant/mood stabilizer), 200mg Welbutrin (mood stabilizer), and .088mg Synthroid (thyroid medication). <br>
<br>
Anyway, I ate the mushrooms at about 4:30 in the afternoon in a hamburger. I was with my brother and his friends and they said we should go to a nature-like place - so we went to this huge park. The first hour I just felt a little light headed and dizzy. I was also shaking a little, but all my meds made me do that anyway, so no body thought too much of it. I was totally enjoying myself in the beautiful surroundings. <br>
<br>
Then I began to have trouble speaking. My words just wouldn't come out how I thought them in my head. I could totally hear and understand other people for the next two hours. Then, about 3 hours after eating the shrooms, I stopped seeing and hearing cognatively. I could walk, but I don't remember seeing where I was going. I sort of blacked out. I never remember getting into the car and going to a different park. This is also when I completely stopped responding to people. I was later told that my friends would be 4 inches away from my face yelling at me, but I showed absolutely no response. I stayed in my own little world like this for a few more hours - it was about 11:00 pm. <br>
<br>
Then I went home, and I was just fine, except that everything I saw looked like water. I could carry on a conversation and the people with me were shocked. Then at about 12:30, I started having trouble speaking again and I threw up. I threw up all over myself, but I didn't realize it in my mind. I was tripping out because I had dreamt about some of the experiences I was having - this guy calling me and not telling me who he was and me throwing up and my mom finding out I did shrooms - they all came true - so I was just thinking about that. I proceeded to throw up for the next 4 hours, until I got taken to the emergency room - luckily, I don't remember my puking episode. Once in the emergency room, I said I was fine and I went home, but I wasn't really fine. I just wanted to go get in my bed because I was starting to feel sad. At 5 in the morning I was still tripping out. <br>
<br>
When I woke up at about 11, I could still see people's faces waving like water, and I felt a little nautious. By early afternoon, I only felt weak - like a bad hangover. I heard stories of my trip and everyone was saying how bad they felt for me, but I didn't understand why because I had lots of fun. I had fun in my mind, by myself, and since I didn't really remember anything bad, everything was cool. <br>
<br>
I had the longest, most unique trip I've ever heard of, and I personally enjoyed it. But for the most part, I don't reccomend it to other people on lots of medications. My doctor explained to me that so much altering of my brain chemicals could have had a much worse outcome - such as permanent brain damage. So, overall, I had a nutz trip, but don't try this at home.
