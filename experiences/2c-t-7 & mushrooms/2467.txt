(apologies for the jumpy disconnected prose that follows; i've temporarily lost linguistic control due to a wild night in the bay area with a group of mad, mad irish hooligans.  oh, me brain)<BR>
<BR>
this occurred in mid june of this year, 2000:<BR>
<BR>
after splitting a quarter of common, average quality mushrooms in a club in downtown dallas, my bro spaz & i traveled to fellow psychonaut j's house, to relax & find some sleep.  sleep soon became a moot point, for when j had ascertained that we were willing, he dosed us with about 25 mg of 2C-T-7, a powder which he suggested we snort.<BR>
<BR>
initially, the only difference in state was a very present, very uncomfortable stinging of the nasal cavities, worse than any kind of speed or other synthetic i've done.  however, within five minutes, the burning had subsided enough to be swallowed by the onset of the drug which manifested only as a euphoric tingle and the stomach-pit sensation of 'this is going to be a very memorable night'--you know, the acid apprehension butterflies.  fairly quickly, my pupils dilated, clarity increased, and i began to see tracers and peripheral suggestions of motion.<BR>
<BR>
oh, setting:  in j's room with spaz and a few other people; j, spaz, myself and k, a sweet girl whom i barely knew all dosed simultaneously.  as colors began to invade the scene and i was getting the silken lysergic-esque wall waving visuals, i felt the strong urge to explore the out of doors, to connect with gaia in what i felt to be an unprecedented clear & receptive state.  energy high and aligned, j, spaz and i left the clutter of ego competition & linear sense behind and journeyed through fenceholes and over walls to a beautiful place full of water and hills and trees in the middle of an apartment complex, very large, surely trespassing.  we played with the surface of the water in a circular pool which surrounded a spiral arrangement of 7 pillars; playing with the water was when i noticed the drug really peaking, probly an hour or less after snorting it.  i found myself able to actually stroke the surface of the water without disturbing it, leaving a wake or any ripples, yet i could _feel_ the surface, like the softest, thinnest silk i've touched.  i noticed a green plasmic sheath of energy around my right hand (my projective/dominant hand) that strayed out in tendrils on the water's surface behind my hand.  to my left, spaz's hand was trailing purple; i remarked upon this to myself and seconds later, j pointed out our respective colors with no prompting, independently verifying my observation.<BR>
<BR>
moments of bonding and spiritual exercises followed, culminating in spaz and myself 'slingshotting' j a space of 100 yds in less than a second.  something about the interaction and harmony of our energies propelled or allowed j to propel himself with a superhuman speed.  to say that he flew would be a little strong, but he definitely did not run or walk.  this was the peak of the evening; upon returning to the apartment, some low-grade marijuana brought back some visuals i'd neglected earlier in favor of the sheer crystalline sense of energy flowing and the bond with my brothers.  <BR>
telepathy functions high on 2c-t-7, as easily evidenced by an episode at the store some 10 hours after snorting, easily back to baseline (almost :) i'm still not, really)  after making the necessary purchases & on our way out of the store, both j and i stopped in our tracks and turned, as one, to buy a few bottles of juice.  we found our synchronicity amusing and thought nothing of it until we got back to the pad once again.  when i entered the room, my friends gaped in astonishment at the load of juice in my arms, saying that they had jokingly decided to 'send' us a message to get some juice while we were at the store.  apparently, it worked for the both of us.  <BR>
<BR>
over all, a highly positive experience, one that has whetted a great appetite for the drug, which we call 'beautiful'.  also a good synergy with the mushrooms.  i would suggest looking into combining them consciously with regards to interdependent peaks.
