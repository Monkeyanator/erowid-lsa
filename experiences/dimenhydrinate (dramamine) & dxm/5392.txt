I have recently been making a habit out of doing DXM.  The more I do it, the better it gets.  On my third experience, however, something went wrong.<BR>
<BR>
After chugging a bottle of cough syrup turned out to be a winner, I wanted to try another OTC high.  Dramamine caught my eye due to its ability to produce 'real' hallucinations.  So I popped all 12 pills and had nothing of a 'trip'.  Extreme paranoia, so extreme that I feared walking on the floor, I feared touching the walls.  When I walked, my right foot would occasionally jolt backward as if I was walking on a frozen pond (I feared my legs would collapse and I would fall).  I saw spiders -- real spiders -- only nobody else could see them (this was horrifying).  Shadows on the ground frightened me.  I was thrust into a social situation, a party, in which everyone was trying to make conversation with me.  I was thinking, 'Hey, it must be so much nicer to be drunk right now.'  I felt antisocial and left the party after knocking over a beer.  What a shitty experience.<BR>
<BR>
The evening of the following day had me still recovering.  I could still feel the drug in me.  As a refresher, I decided to retread on familiar turf and take 800mg of pure Dextromethorphan powder.  This dosage was not much larger than my previous ones -- only a difference of 100 mg.  Anyway, the trip was the most intense experience of my life.<BR>
<BR>
Maybe it was the Dramamine that altered things, but this trip was more shamanic.  I was a cartoon character, mouthing what I thought to be words, but what turned out to be gibberish.  This frightened my cohorts, who looked like distorted ogres.  As I lay in my bed, my legs would move inward by themselves, a similar feeling I got from the Dramamine.  My bed became a raft, and I was suddenly in what appeared to be a vivid dream.<BR>
<BR>
I was in the middle of the ocean with Tom Hanks, escaping the island from 'Cast Away'.  Tom had long hair and a beard, and the nighttime scenery was just as beautiful as in the film.  This wasn't a dream, though -- it was an image.  An image that was so clear, but still so hard to explain.  It was like I was viewing myself from a different perspective, not from the raft.  Other images ('Open Eye Visuals') were received in the same matter during future trips.  Most of them completely dominated the normal things being viewed.  In other words, I was literally inside these scenes, not reality.<BR>
<BR>
It's hard to recall, but I remember watching MTV (I love to do this on DXM) and getting behind the exteriors of certain Hollywood 'stars'.  The VJ made me shiver at the fact that he was the biggest asshole ever . . . off-camera, of course.  I got into the lavish lives of other famous people and saw their true selves as well.  Still, I wanted their fortune.<BR>
<BR>
I then got whisked into the future and saw myself on the red carpet during the Oscars, wife in hand, smiling and waving to the cameras.  Did I mention that I want to direct films?  Odd how vivid this particular OEV was.  I thought I was watching a show on E!.<BR>
<BR>
My roommate walked into the room and asked, 'Are you tripping?'  I said yeah, and he put his trip software onto his computer in front of me.  Staring at this with 3-D glasses on deepened the trip immensely.  In fact, this pretty much made it.<BR>
<BR>
I remember seeing God.  Yes, my interpretation of Him.  He was a pure cartoon, the typical cliched version of what He may look like, white hair smothering His face.  It was a wavy painting with the pastiness of His hair melting into the clouds.  I just wish I had something to say.<BR>
<BR>
Not only did I see God and my apparent future, but I saw something in the past.  DXM was trying to tell me something that involved my father as a hippie back in the day.  I saw a clear image of him against the background of the trip toy, an image just as clear as the others.  Too bad I didn't comprehend what I was being told.  In fact, I didn't learn as much as I should have from these God-given incidents.<BR>
<BR>
That's as much as I remember, although so much more occured.  Well, you can cram a lot into 24 hours, because the drug failed to wear off.  At breakfast the next morning, I couldn't function.  I was scared to pick up a tray because my arms would not have been able to hold it.  I felt autistic and feared brain damage, although I knew that wasn't likely.  I thought it would never wear off, but it did almost exactly 24 hours later.  My guess is that the Dramamine, which was still strong in my body, had contributed to the lengthened trip.  If not, it sure did something.  This was definitely a high Third Plateau experience, if not Fourth.  I've had pseudo-Out_Of_Body_Experiences, but never this.  Needless to say I haven't been discouraged from the wonderful world of D-X-M.
