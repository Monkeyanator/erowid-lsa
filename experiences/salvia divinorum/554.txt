After researching Salvia Divinorum, or as I call it, Sal, on the net, I decided to order some for myself to see if it was real.  Because I am under the age of 18, and could not buy it online, I decided to go out on a limb and send $11 for a 1/4 oz. of dried salvia leaves.<BR>
<BR>
About a week had passed since I sent the money to the compnay, and I believed that either the mail or the company did something with the money.  This was not too bad because I understood before I sent the money away that the this could happen.  Well, when I got off the bus, I went to go get the mail, and sure enough, the package was there.  <BR>

Ok, not to bore you anymore, I'll tell about my experience with Sal.  That night, when none of my family was upstairs near my room, I decided to open my window and have a few hits.  It was a dark cold night and was kind of scary even without the Salvia.  I took a hit, then another, then one after that.  Soon after, like 30 seconds after, the effects took part in my body as I looked at the trees swaying, they seemed to me like they were all dancing in unison, something real weird like out of a fairytale or something.  Then I looked over at my neighbor's house and imagined the mother was telling me to stop smoking or something, so with that I decided to close up my window.  This however, was more difficult that I expected: This task probably took me about 2 minutes to, which is extrememly sad.  After that ordeal was done, I decided to turn the lights off and lay in my bed.  I imagined a little dwarf kind of guy on top of a tall mushroom right in front of me.  I took a shower, and before I finished, I felt fine.<BR>

To conclude, this experience was a new one for me seeing how I am not a hard drug user (only smoking bud and drinking).  It was weird, the few hits I took, there were no visions; however, my mind assured me that yes, there was a dwarf on a mushroom, and yes the trees were swaying together.  The one problem with Sal is that it doesn't last long enough (the actual high is only like 3-5 minutes after smoking.  And the following 20 minutes are kind of like beeing burnt out, but not so dopey).  I want to order some of the 5x when I have a chance (and the money).
