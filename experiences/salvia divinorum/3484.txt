Recently, my best friend and I performed our first few experiments with Salvia. Here are some short descriptions of what I experienced.<BR>
<BR>
Experiments 1-3:<BR>
After reading several trip reports I was aware that the best method of smoking salvia requires a bong or water pipe, but since I didn't have one I figured a standard pipe would do. I was wrong. We smoked a ton of the stuff and never got any serious effects because we would always choke on or swallow the smoke (IT'S HARSH!), and couldn't take very big hits. My experiences were still pleasant nonetheless. I experiened something like closed eye visuals and in my third experiment, feelings of euphoria. However, these quickly gave way to tiredness.<BR>
<BR>
Experiments 4-5: <BR>
The day of purchasing a moderately sized bong...We got home from work very late at night with the bong and decided we didn't want to wait until the next night, so I packed the biggest bowl I could (about .5 grams) and smoked it while Chris went to do some school work. It hit me almost instantaneously and I began to giggle, I was able to hold my laughter enough to finnish the bowl off and just as I did I began talking to someone in my mind. At this point I was in a very confused and giggly state. I was talking to a girl, at the same time I was the girl. I asked her 'Do you think we should go tell chris how f**ked up I am?' We decided against it and I layed down, upon laying down I began to feel exteme euphoria somewhat like the effects of extasy. this went on for ten minutes or so (though it felt like 3) and faded away as quickly as it came on.<BR>
<BR>
  When Chris came back from writing his essay he smoked some (again about .5 grams) and immediately began laughing. He laughed for about 3 minutes straight and then mumbled something about feet and then silently tripped out for another three miutes or so. <BR>

  After him, I went for it again. I smoked three big hits, and when I glanced up at Chris (peeking over the top bunk of my bed) I began to laugh harder than I have ever laughed before, at the same time I began to lose reality and somehow I passed the bong up to Chris and choked out the words 'finish it.' I contiued to laugh as I began to  forget who I was, where I was and who Chris was. As before, I thought there were others in the room, and I wanted to tell them to make this person (Chris) stop looking at me so I could stop laughing. I laughed and laughed until the effects faded away.
