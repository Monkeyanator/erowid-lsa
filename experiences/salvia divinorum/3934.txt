After reading all the trips on the web about salvia, I finally decided to buy some and try to get into the salvia world. I was so anxious to finally get my salvia. I read about people going to other places and all that kind of thing.<BR>

3 days ago, I got my salvia, and decided to give it a try this week-end. I placed 1 gram of the shit in my water pipe, and smoked it all in 4 hits. I never got any hallucination of all kind, except a little light buzz. I also tried 1/5 gram of my 5X extract and never got any hallucination.<BR>

I don't know what I did wrong.
