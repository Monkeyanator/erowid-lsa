Well, where do I start..I recieved 1 gram of Salvia Divinorum from Oaxaca, Mexico. I had been anticipating this day for quite some time, and I was in for an experience I will never forget. I called two of my friends over to try this out with me and they agreed and came over as soon as possible. I explained to them that this was a sacred herb used by the Mazatec Indians and should be treated with great respect. They agreed. <BR>

I put on a CD by a band called Tribes Of Neurot to help set the mood, which it did and we began to smoke Salvia. My friend was the first to inhale. I told him to make sure he held the smoke in for 30 seconds and he did. Next it was me, I took a hit standing up and held it in for as long as I could and exhaled. My other friend repeated the step, and we kept smoking. I felt nothing but mild effects that marijuana produces and my friends did too. I was disappointed, because I had expected much more, but that was yet to come. So, time passed and my friends left and that left me all alone. <BR>

About 2 hours later I decided to smoke the rest of the gram, but this time sitting down in a comfortable position. I packed a bowl and began to smoke. After holding the smoke in for quite some time, I started to feel the effects, and these effects were MUCH different than what I had experienced earlier in the day. I felt as if my soul had left me and I forgot who I was, that followed by an overwhelming feeling of fear and terror. I put my bong down, and was unable to think positively. After moments of this overwhelming fear, I started thinking why I was feeling this way, and I came to the conclusion that the Gods were punishing me for taking Salvia in vain. I sat in the lotus position, bowed my head and closed my eyes, and began saying a prayer to the Gods to forgive me for forgetting that Salvia was a sacred herb and not to be taken in in vain. After repeating my prayer over and over I opened my eyes, feeling 'normal' once again. The experience was nothing like I had experienced before! I mean, LSD isn't as intense as this is! At least with LSD I know who I am and don't feel an overwhelming feeling of terror. I hope to try Salvia again in the near future, but before I take that jouney again, I have to remind myself that it is a sacred herb and it should be smoked for the effects of marijuana that I had felt previously in the day time...
