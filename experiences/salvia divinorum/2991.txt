First experimentation:<BR>
<BR>
I sat on my porch and lit 1 bowl of pure Salvia leaves.<BR>
The first hit was very potent, instantaneously I felt gravity pulling<BR>
me towards the ground. I could feel the magnetic floor trying to<BR>
devour me, though I struggled to free away from the calling of the floor.<BR>
With all the stress (earth pulling me, and I pulling away from it) my body<BR>
was ripped into two. Like a bubble splitting into two. I started to<BR>
giggle, but held the laughter because people were sleeping (this was around<BR>
11:30PM). I started to run around our car. It was fun because I was running counter-clockwise, and my other self clockwise. The next thing I did was run into my room. Though I knew I was running straight into the open door, but I suddenly ran into the wall. It seemed that one of me was running through the door, but I was actually the other me who ran into the wall next to the door. I didn't really care about the pain since I was having too much fun. I sat down in front of my computer and started to yack about what was happening to me to my local friends who were in a private AIM chat (they were going to experiment with me as well later at 12AM). <BR>
<BR>
This was cool because I was seeing my hands typing gibberish, but I was actually on the other end of the room. This was the time when the Salvia was starting to wear off (T+3minutes). I felt my other self start to reunite with me, after a few seconds I was back to my normal self, safe in one piece. Heeheehee.<BR>
<BR>
Second experimentation (later that night/morning):<BR>
<BR>
I met my friends in a park located next to a large patch of big trees. I let my friends take their hits and watched them enjoy the magical herb. When it was my turn I distanced myself away from them and started the spiritual voyage. I took a large hit of 5X extract (around 150mg), I was<BR>
amazed that nothing had happened to me. So I took another big hit and held<BR>
it for a long period of time (20seconds or so). When I blew away the smoke<BR>
I started to trip out. I looked around me and saw my whole surroundings<BR>
starting to dance. Then I felt like I was part of the trees around me, they<BR>
were being absorbed by my skin visually and spiritually. I started to laugh, but I held the laughter. I stood up and started to walk around me. <BR>
<BR>
Something very far away was calling me. I started to walk towards it. Suddenly everything started to twist around, and a friend of mine was walking towards me. He was in the middle of all these twists. This lasted for a minute or so. I returned to my other friends and started to tell them my story. It was fun.<BR>
<BR>
Thoughts:<BR>
<BR>
I love Salvia, but I wish the trip was a bit longer. I probably didn't enjoy it that much since my shroom trip was even better. Like, Salvia * 1,000 = magic shrooms. I'll try alone next time with one sitter. This time it will be 10x extract in my room. I will use a jet-lighter so I can vaporize the active ingredients, and inhale them through a water bong (we used a small, metal hand pipe this time). I'll be playing soothing music and try to meditate.
