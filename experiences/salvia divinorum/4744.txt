I bought the Salvia from a local agricultural extension...I got home, got out my vaporizer bong and tried it. One hit. Two hits. Three hits. Kept going. Second bowl. Third bowl. Nothing.<BR>

I tried it again later, to see if it was because I was inexperienced with this stuff. Nothing. Either my standard of intoxication is VERY high, or this stuff is minor league. <BR>

Weed is better.
