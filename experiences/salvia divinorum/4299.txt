I have been growing entheogenic plants for about three years. Among my collection are three large Salvia divinorum plants. I have wanted to try Salvia d. for a while, so one night I gathered my courage and tore off about 5 big leaves. I didn't wait to dry them out, as I have heard that fresh leaves are better.<BR>
<BR>
I sat down on my bed and packed a bowl, not really sure what to expect. I smoked all the leaves I had picked, and lay down with the lights off. Within about a minute I began to feel something. My head felt heavy, and it took a whole lot of effort to move. <BR>
<BR>
I closed my eyes, and that's when I started to see/imagine things. I was an enormous cactus in the middle of a desert. There was nothing around me. I saw the cactus from the perspective of an observer, but I knew that the cactus was me. <BR>
<BR>
I was kind of floating between consiousness and sleep. At times I became a little scared, and I felt like something was watching me<BR>
<BR>
Eventually I fell asleep. I woke up and I was real tired for most of the day. Overall, my Salvia experience was not an incredibly pleasant one. It was comparable to one of those dreams you get when you are sick with a fever. I don't know if I will end up trying it again.
