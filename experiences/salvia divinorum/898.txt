Salvia was not 'fun', but more like scary. Me and a buddy bought this 6x stuff and decided to try it one saturday afernoon. Quick background. I used drugs, buddy had never even smoked weed. Anyway, we loaded up a pipe and did all the things we had to do to 'get the feeling'. We took 3 hits deep hits apeice. I immediately felt a wave of fear go over me. My heart rate went up, face turned red, my extremities went cold and clammy, and all i wanted to do was Not be on this level. I felt like i was ready to lose total control or die. I did not like that feeling. My buddy felt very little. I was 'ill' for 1 hour. Never smoked the rest. I still have it.
