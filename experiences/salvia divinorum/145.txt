My first experience with Salvia Divinorum was not a pleasant one, probably due to lack of preparation.  I was slightly hung over from the night before, and had slept too late into the day.  However, since I wouldn't have another hour alone in my house until two days later, I decided to go ahead and try smoking .5 grams of Salvia leaf.<BR>

The first thing that struck me was the harshness of the smoke.  (I don't smoke anything, except the occasional puff of quality cannabis).  After finishing almost all of the bowl, I began to experience visual effects.  A window I was looking at while I smoked seemed to bend, and warp.  I remember wondering at the time if it was due to holding my breath for so long, or Salvia, and decided that it was definately the herb.  <BR>

Upon finishing the smoke, I felt dizzy, and uncoordinated.  Similar, but not identical to the feeling produced by DXM intoxiacation.  My lungs felt uncomfortable, probably due to the fact that I seldom smoke anything.  I didn't experience any more visual effects, but there was a definite mental aspect which was indescribably different from LSD, Mushrooms, and any other entheogen I had previously used.<BR>

I slept some more, due to the lingering effects of my hangover, and experienced dreams laden with symblols which were meaningful to me, but which I cannot share due to their personal nature.  Salvia is a powerful drug, but I cannot recommend it as a recreational drug.  I plan to use it again, under better circumstances, but, in the future, I plan to chew the leaves.
