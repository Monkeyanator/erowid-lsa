today, i got hold of some salvia divinorum, which i had been reading up about here, so i was expecting to have to be careful with my dosage. i came back home with 3 other friends, and we started taking bong hits,and holding them down for 1 min + but getting no effects.one friend said that he had it once before with a pill, and it took him to another galaxy (i had some then, but not the pill, and got no effect). anyway, he left soon, and me and the other 2 kept going. soon we had taken probably about 20 bong hits (the whole 1/8 ounce of salvia), and felt nothing at all. i read that around 10% of people wont get an effect, but none out of the 4 of us did. im really not surprised this is legal, it really is quite shit
