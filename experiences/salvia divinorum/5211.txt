I was in Amsterdam, and didn't know about the drug -- got it at a 'Smart Shop,' eager to try it.  In my tiny hotel room, alone, I filled a bowl.  The TV was on.  Nothing happened, so I smoked a second bowl.  Waiting. . .<BR>
 <BR>
Zap!  I was somewhere else, a place without three dimensions.  I think it had two dimensions, but I'm not sure.  I felt frightened and smothered.  I couldn't breath.<BR>
 <BR>
Visually, everything was both the same and not the same.  Grand colorful patterns in constant motion, but when I recall what I saw it was my small hotel room.<BR>
<BR>
The voice on the television, (I don't understand Dutch) was saying things right to me, directly addressing my situation.<BR>
<BR>
In the same way as a lot of other people reported, I had completely forgotten that I had smoked the drug.  I was scared.<BR>
<BR>
And there was a lucid part of me that said, 'You're in a foreign country, and you've gone completely insane, and they will have to carry you out of here in a straightjacket, on a stretcher.'  What will happen to me?  There was no question that I would never be able to escape from this two dimensional world where I could not breathe and did not know how to move.  I was in a lot of trouble.<BR>
<BR>
I screamed.  I think what I said was 'Help!'  Really dumb to yell help in a hotel in a country not one's own.  At that point I came pretty much down and was expecting the Dutch police to break into my room at any moment.  I ran out in the hall and down the steps so they would not find me and a few minutes later came back into my room feeling foolish.<BR>
<BR>
I was shocked!  In the '60s I was the acid superman.  If people told me that 1/4 of Mighty Quinns (a local acid) was scary, I would take two wholes.  But this stuff scared the shit out of me.  <BR>
<BR>
I looked on it as a challenge, and tried it a number of times more.  Each time I was frightened, and forgot that I had taken the drug. The second time I thought I had greatly improved because I had managed not to scream.  The third time I managed to maintain some Yoga breathing, but my breath came in and out of a pink volcano.  All my consciousness was in my breath, but I was still scared, and it was all that I could do to keep from losing myself in the fear.<BR>
<BR>
I tried it a few more times but never got good control.  I still have some but will save it until I feel ready, or until I get a good guide.  <BR>
<BR>
I wish someone had been with me to keep me focused.
