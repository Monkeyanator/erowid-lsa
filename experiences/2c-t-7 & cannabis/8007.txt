Once again 2C-T-7 has provided me with a wonderful experience. I took 35 mg of 2C-T-7 (disolved in everclear) about 7:00PM and had to deal with the unsettled stomach for the first hour and a half after it kicked in (9:00PM). Pot helped settle my stomach and by about 12:00 my muscle tension had gone away and everything was just sparkley etc. <BR>

I was at a large outdoor party and enjoyed walking around and listening to music. I felt the effects until about 7:30AM the next morning as the sun rose. 2C-T-7 taken orally has given me the best visuals. I suggest that for the impatient person to smoke 5mg on some pot as you take your oral dose and then you will be cool.
