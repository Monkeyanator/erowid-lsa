i took one pill and about half an hour later (when i was just starting to feel the x) my friend took me in the other room and gave me a whip it...when i let out the nitrous i fell on the bed and immedately got one of the best body rush's i ever had. the fuzzyness was much much more intense and for a moment i felt like i was somewhere else. before the nitrous even wore off the x kicked in with a bang. <BR>

i know this is supposed to be more then how fucked up i got or what i saw but i cant really say it was more then that. it wasnt an out of body experience and since i dont take acid i cant say that i learned anything about myself, but i took mine early on.  i think it was a great way to start the night.  my other friends took their whip its later on in the night and said that it was so much better, one actually said that he hallucinated harder then he ever has on acid... i suppose that its dangerous to do mix and match drugs huh?
