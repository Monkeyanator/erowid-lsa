Over the course of my life I hav been a progressive drug user, nce I found DXM I thought I had it made.  Easy to get, very fun and also cheap.  It was only after I started having terrifyingly lucid dreams that lead me to a psychotic fear of the millenium I had to stop using it.  The dream was always the same,  I am with a large number of people I see a light in the skay and suddenly the sky opens up with a blinding light and I feel my soul being wretched from my body and I see my body fall lifeless to the cold ground as I scream in horrifc terror you could never ever imagine.  suffice it to say it sucks.  I have had hundred of variations of this dream, it all started with the DXM but now it happens even though I don't do it any more.<BR>

N-E-ways you probably guessed i don't sleep too well so I bought some sleeping pills, I've got tons of them.  recently melatonin was recommended to me by a friend.  Last night I took three 3mg tablets of melatonin.  I had the dream, much more clearly, only this time I felt I could manage it.  I knew not to be afraid, it didn't matter.  The terror was gone.  I always used to wake up after the one part of my dream, but this lated much longer.  I was able to complete my dream and I think that was important.  I don't know if these effects are lasting, but I know I'm sure as hell buying another bottle today.
