      2ml kava extract 25mg<BR>

kava is almost immediately sedating and euphoria accompanied by tingling of extremeties is mild but noticeable.  in extract form it is taken orally under the tongue then swallowed so it is picked up by salivary glands and metabolized quickly in the stomach.<BR>

I feel well rested and have a sense of well-being.  I recommend KavaKava in a social setting, but it's not mind-altering to any noteable degree.  At least not for me.
