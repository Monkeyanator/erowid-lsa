Recently my friend matt and I were walking around outside on a very nice Sunday. We had just left our friend Josh's house and we wanted to pick up some weed but didn't have any money. Determined to get fucked up, I suggested taking motion sickness pills because I heard you would trip if you took enough. So we walked down to the grocery store and I pocketed two containers of Dramamine original formula and two boxes of vivarin. Matt and I then left the store, went up a couple of blocks and each took 11 Dramamine tablets (It was about 2:30 pm). The tablets went down very easy but they left us both with a bad after taste, nothing a glass of water can't cure.<BR>
 <BR>
We then decided to walk back over Josh's house. After walking about a block I started to feel light headed and sort of dizzy but it wasn't a bad feeling Matt was saying he felt the same. We got about a block away from Josh's house and I said to Matt 'I feel pretty good' and he started laughing then I started laughing and we didn't stop until we got to Josh's (2:45 pm). Josh came out and we started walking around again. I gave Matt 8 vivarin, Josh 4, and I took 6. (I've taken 6 vivarin before and it didn't really affect me too much). It was about 3:00 pm and I still wasn't seeing any visuals but I was kind of out of it, like I didn't feel fucked up but i didn't feel normal either. <BR>
<BR>
We stopped off at another friends house and that's when the vivarin kicked in I was totally wired, My eye's were wide open but yet I was very relaxed, it was about 3:45 when we left and still no visuals. We then started walking up to the park. I noticed i couldn't really walk totally straight and I was having trouble remembering things. After this point I pretty much stopped talking cause i would forget what i was going to say. We got to the park and I sat down and started looking at everything around me. The trees and grass looked a lot greener and the sky and lake looked a lot brighter and more bluish. I felt like I was in total bliss. Josh then came up to me and asked me if I wanted to run with him but I was in no mood to even move. So I just said no. <BR>
<BR>
At about 5:30 Josh went home and Matt and I went over to a school and sat on the steps. at this time it was around 6:00 pm, the sun was going down and it was very easy for me to just zone out. When it was totally dark and the streetlights came on I started seeing mild visuals. The streetlights had huge glowing circles around them. I walked by a parked car and saw a dog sitting in the passenger seat staring at me but then when i looked closer there was nothing there. And that's all I seen as far as visuals. it was about 8:00 pm when I decided to go home. By this time I felt fine, just tired.<BR>
<BR>
NOTE: a couple things I forgot to add. From the time I was at the park until I went home, my hands kept turning blue and I thought that I wasn't getting any circulation to my hands.  I kept thinking (I don't know why) that I was going to get gangrene in my hands and they would have to be amputated. (That totally sucked!). Also I kept feeling my heart and it kept changing beats like it would do 6 really fast beats but then it would slow down and do 4 slow beats.  (This also totally sucked because it just added to my gangrene paranoia.)<BR>

OVERALL OPINION: If your terribly bored and have no money go for it. Otherwise just go get some weed, it's a lot more fun and probably safer too.
