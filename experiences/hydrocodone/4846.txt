One night, I traded a friend's aunt 2 joints for 5 generic 7.5 mg hydrocodone pills, it wasnt a great deal on my part, but I can't complain.<BR>
<BR>
I extracted the pills using the Hot/Cold Codeine Extraction. <BR>
<BR>
I had done hydrocodone once before, but I had done 70 mgs then, so I knew that this wouldn't be anywhere as strong, but I was hoping it would be close.<BR>
<BR>
10:00 : Drink The Liquid<BR>
10:17 : The hydrcodone kicks in. It's a great buzz, i feel like I am on top of the world and I can do anything.<BR>
10:49 : The buzz is wearing off, I am very tired now.<BR>
11:40 : All traces of a buzz is gone, and I am sober once again, I had some back pain earlier in the day which lasted through the night, but the hydrocodone got rid of that, and it's still gone.
