Wanting to try some opium related stuff again, I got some old hydrocodone pills.  I had five and used the Codeine extraction method.  I probably lost some stuff in during the extraction so I probably had around 30 mg.<BR>
<BR>
I drank the concrete tasting hydrocodone water at around 6:30 pm.  At around 7:00 The high all of a sudden hit me.  I had a big goofy smile and I felt like sinking into my couch like jello, not a care in the world.  I had a buzz like that for about an hour.  Then things started happening.<BR>
<BR>
I felt real tired so I started to close my eyes and dift asleep.  I wasn't quite asleep yet but very close to, almost in a trance.  What ever I was thinking about or anything I heard got transformed into a dream.  So I guess I was dreaming while I was awake.  I don't know what happened next was because of the hydrocodone, but it was damn scary, and cool.<BR>
<BR>
I thought that people were coming up the stairs, I swear I heard footsteps, But when I shook my head and opened my eyes to see who was there, nothing.  Fell back and closed my eyes.  Five minutes later I hear my parents having a conversation, I answer them with a big loud, 'whatttt!'  But then I opened my eyes and realized that no one was home.  A couple more things like this kept happening.  I swear that everything I heard was real.  It was so real, that it was unreal.<BR>
<BR>
I guess I finally fell asleep when I was having a dream about drowning or something.  I remember somebody kept saying to get out of the water.  I then suddenly opened my eyes and woke up (this is the real world) and I was trying to mouth out help or something.  I seriously could not move or talk....scariest shit ever.  I tried to move my arms, legs, nothing would move, I tried to shake my head back and forth and talk but all I did was mouth out words.  After the third time trying I shook my head as hard as I could and broke my body from whatever was holding me.  At first I was terrified, but then I caught my breath and looked and thought about it, I thought it was damn cool cause it was so unreal.  <BR>
<BR>
Im just wondering if anyone has had an experience like this opium related or drug related or an experience like this at all.
