I just recently came across some hydrocodone from a friend, and having heard it was similar to codeine and heroin, figured i would try it. Tonight seemed like a good night to do it with no one else awake in the house, and i was already feeling good. i hadn't taken anything except for ibuprofen in the morning for a headache and a fat joint last night. i did not extract the hydrocodone, I just broke the pills in half and swallowed the acetamenaphen too (2g).<BR>
<BR>
1:00a.m. - took 3 vicodin 5/500 tablets, broken in half, and put on 'mailorder is fun' for some music.<BR>
<BR>
1:20 - feel a funny tingling feeling starting in my arms then spreading to the rest of my body.<BR>
<BR>
1:27 - feel a little numbness and dizziness, muscles twitching to deep bass in music.<BR>
<BR>
1:30 - more dizzy, getting floaty like codeine, eyes sensitive to light.<BR>
<BR>
1:34 - too clumsy to read a far side calender without knocking it over; tripping over shoes; and strongly hearing little sounds.<BR>
<BR>
1:40 - i'm getting very high for sure now. i love it.<BR>
<BR>
1:50 - sitting and closing my eyes i go into a trance-like state; time is getting very distorted with music flying and clocks really slow. wow.<BR>
<BR>
2:01 - some visual effects and waves; i want it all longer and stronger so I pop another 5 mg vicodin.<BR>
<BR>
2:06 - shit its making me real slow and kind of tired. i think i'm about to peak. hopefully the fourth pill keeps me high longer. shit that took 3 min. to write.<BR>
<BR>
2:15 - music over, i just peaked and am putting on the Beatles for the comedown. i think the fourth pill will prolong the high.<BR>
<BR>
2:26 - the last pill is keeping me high, but not as high.<BR>
<BR>
2:48 - i'm typing this and am pretty much sober.<BR>
<BR>
well i think the hydrocodone was definitely a good drug to have an experience with, as it was fun, relaxing, and nothing bad came of it. I recommend the experience to anyone who's interested, but i don't think a first dose should be over 30mg. and remember, it is addictive, so don't use it too often.
