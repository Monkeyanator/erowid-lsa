After doing a great deal of reasearch on various psychoactive plants, I stumbled upon an oddly familiar one.  The large white trumpet flowers instantly screamed Datura.  I never knew before, just how many grow downtown in people's yards.  Quite excited at this find, I decided to pick a bunch of leaves and 2 immature seed pods.<BR>
<BR>
When I got home, I boiled about a cup of water in the microwave with 2 Datura leaves and a few immature white seeds.  When the tea was ready it had a yellow tinge to it, but the liquid was very translucent still.  I added a bit of honey to mask the nasty taste of the Datura and sipped it down.<BR>

There were some initial effects that began to kick in after about 20 minutes as I proceeded to bike over to a friend's condo.  I started to get a bit drowsy, noises got turned down, and my mouth was getting pretty dry.  On that note, make sure that you have water when using Datura, or you'll dehydrate (and that hurts).  After about an hour and a half, the real effects started to kick in.  My eyes felt a bit funny like they were swolen.  This didn't hurt, but it did feel funny.  I went into my friend's washroom and checked my eyes; the pupils were huge, you could only see about a mm of iris left.  Then the wierd shit started to happen.  I found it difficult to balance when I tried to walk, and I began to see fleeting images of people out of the corner of my eye.  As well, I got pretty incoherent.  I would be talking to my friend and not being totally into the conversation.  At no point did I feel any nausea though.<BR>

Everything got very surreal and certain objects in my friend's appartment stood out more than normal.  When I went home, I saw my mom, and I was sure that she had a black eye, even though she didn't.  I kept asking her why she had a black eye.  Later that night, I got an email from my girlfriend, which I read, but after I went to sleep and woke up today, I wasn't sure of anything I had done in the period of time that I was under influence.  I couldn't remember if I had actually talked to my mom, or gotten that email.  I checked later and I had done all these things, but I still wasn't sure in my own mind.<BR>
<BR>
A summary of the effects that this had on me is as follows:<BR>
 -Blurred vision (only for up-close objects)<BR>
 -Incoherent speech<BR>
 -Lack of balance<BR>
 -Dry mouth and throat<BR>
 -Mild hallucinations (inanimate objects looking like<BR>
  people)<BR>
 -Delerium<BR>
 -Some breathing difficulty (not much though)<BR>
 -Sucking shit at Unreal Tournament<BR>

To conclude, Datura is not for casual use because you are put in a dreamy state and it is difficult to discern what is real and what isn't. However, I have noticed no ill effects as of yet, perhaps my dosage was too low for any wild hallucinations and prolonged loss of vision.  Anyway, if you're going to take datura, I would suggest starting with a brew of two leaves, it'll give you a good taste of the potential of Datura.
