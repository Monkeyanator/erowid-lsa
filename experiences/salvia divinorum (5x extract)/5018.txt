My friend J called me up one night around 7pm or so telling me that he had finally received his long awaited package. The package contained 1 gram of 5x extract, and 1 gram of 10x extract.<BR>
<BR>
We called up another friend, B, and upon his arrival lit up a candle in the middle of the room and sorted out each of our doses. I got to go first. I packed the bong and took a deep breath. This was my first time, so I was a bit nervous about the whole thing.<BR>
<BR>
I calmed myself down and lit the bowl. I inhaled about half of the bowl and passed it on to B. I made sure I held in the smoke until after B had passed the bong over to J. <BR>
<BR>
Almost as soon as I exhaled, I noticed my skin become tingley and I got a little light headed for a second. Suddenly I felt like Play-Doh that had just gone through one of those toys you'd play with as a kid that turned it into spagetti type strands. <BR>

With a Best Of David Bowie CD in the background I found myself on a farm/carnival. David Bowie kept trying to talk to me. And I started to get a little scared. I heard my name, as I looked up while J was handing me the bong for a second round, I felt as though I was some how a necessary element to the farm/carnival land I had visited. Each one of us was just a molecule to a bigger larger world. <BR>
<BR>
I take the bong and inhale a rather large amount of smoke. But Im unable to hold it in at all and immediatly exhale. I had the bong back to B and drift back into my altered reality. I can feel myself swaying back and forth. So I look up to see whats going on. I find that I am just a strand of thread on the scarf of a large being that appeared to be made of clay. David Bowie keeps chanting in my ear but Im unsure of what hes trying to say. <BR>

5 min. from when I inhaled the first hit. The trip was over. I was afraid at first of what had happened. But I long to experience the amazing power of Salvia yet again.
