12:00 AM.   wife and kids asleep.  i go downstairs into the playroom<BR>
and smoke one bong hit of the extract.   within 20 seconds, i  became one of the pickets of a white picket fence.    no other memories of my life  or even the fact that i am a living person.   i was never living.  i was, am, and will always be just a part of a white picket fence.   i  opened my eyes out of fear  and it took a minute or so to realize i am a person.   now, as far as the white picket fence is concerned, i think i have a clue.   i was telling my wife  before she went to bed  that i want to go on a vacation with the family because life was feeling pretty routine.   so maybe me being part of a fence is the manifestation  of  sameness, routine, etc...
