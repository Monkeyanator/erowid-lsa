Over the last year of using Salvia Divinorum extract once or twice every three months, I am struck by the undeniable fact that this substance has been leading me on a specific trajectory of journeys.<BR>

On the surface, it seems that every trip I take on this drug takes up where the previous one left off. In the beginning, I thought that the forays into what I now seemingly quaintly, but completely honestly, call hyperspace, were just going to be limited to the feelings of awe and stoned terror at witnessing the deepening twists and bends of space/time and all the spirit beings that inhabit its nooks and crannies. I never felt completely comfortable experiencing this unfolding of reality. However, that period now appears to be past, a necessary step in learning how to use Salvia for spirit journeys.<BR>

The bending of reality now seems more like a beckoning gateway, and my initial terror more like the shock at trying to wrap my feeble mind around this gateway's radically novel nature. The plant guide now beckons me to release my ego and slide into one of the reality tunnels formed by the bending of space/time, which, in turn, leads me to being spit out the other side, usually just in time to witness the most gorgeous otherworldly events, events I can only describe as sunsets over infinity. I am then gently slingshotted back to my current reality/body, as if a gentle guiding influence had grabbed, pulled, and firmly whispered 'enough for now, little one'.
