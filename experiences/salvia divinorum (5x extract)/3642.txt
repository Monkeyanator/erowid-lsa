Well, I can tell you that Salvia is just about the weirdest substance I have ever tried - suffice it to say that it's not something I'll do on a regular basis. <BR>
<BR>
Set: Nervous and excited, but looking forward to it (first time!)<BR>
Setting: Good friend's house, outside, late morning. Lying on a duvet with pillows. Gentle breeze. Good people to trip with.<BR>
Substance: 5X Extract (15mg Salvinorin-A per g of leaf)<BR>
Total dose: 150mg (T = 50mg, T+10 = 100mg)<BR>
<BR>
The first attempt (50mg) didn't work much - Just a feeling that my whole body was very heavy - Like gravity took on whole new different characteristics (It felt like at least 2 G's). Also, while lying on my back, it felt like from the waist down, I was lying on the ground, but from the waist up, I was 'sticking out over the edge of reality' This is really hard to explain, but it was like from the waist up, gravity changed direction for the whole universe except myself. At this stage there were absolutely no visuals. There was, however a *very* powerful sense of dissociation. The other people present seemed like they were off in the distance. This part of the 'voyage' reminded me of a thinners / glue buzz.<BR>
<BR>
I waited about ten minutes to come down a bit, and then reloaded for Round 2. This time I took a double dose (about 100mg) and made sure that I drew the lighter flame down onto the Salvia for the full duration of the hit. (The smoke is pretty harsh and we all had a hard time keeping it in for the 30 seconds required - We were also using a very small corn-cob pipe. Next time I'll definately use a water-cooled bong). After 30 seconds, I exhaled and started to take another 'flamed' hit. At this stage I could feel the effects coming like a steam train. I vaguely remember handing the pipe off to one of the others and laughing madly, then...<BR>
<BR>
I sat there, feeling heavy and vaguely dissappointed that nothing was happening. I looked at the others and could see that they were checking to see if anything was going to occur. I stretched out my arms to show them 'look, I'm fine' but I couldn't seem to get my hands disentangled from the house. I looked along one arm and was amused to see that about halfway up my forearm, the skin changed colour and texture so that my hands blended seamlessly into the house. I sensed that this was perfectly normal. At this point, I said to everyone 'look - my hands are stuck to the house!' I could hear them all laughing.<BR>
<BR>
I then opened my eyes and looked up at the others. Now it seemed that I was sitting underneath the ground, stuck to the side wall of a glass box and the roof of the same box simultaneously. I was both looking up through the blades of grass at the others who were sitting on the 'edge' of this box, and looking down/sideways at them. The grass was transparent but also completely opaque. I had a profound sense that all of this had happened before. <BR>
<BR>
I felt like I was in the past, sitting outside a very familiar childhood home with very familiar people (like really intense deja-vu). I can't really describe this very well, but I got the distinct impression that I had 'remembered' what it was like to take Salvia - Like I had done it thousands of times before, but I had somehow forgotten those times. Now I remember (This feeling is still with me now!). (By the way, to the others, I was lying on my back with my eyes shut and a grin on my face. My hands were moving slightly, but otherwise I was completely still throughout the above)<BR>
<BR>
I 'closed' my eyes again, and instantly dropped into a flat eternal plane of grey. This is probably the hardest part to describe. I somehow knew that there was someone with me (The Salvia Entity), but that she was not yet ready to show me her secrets. She was both me and the plane and eveything else - This was her universe. I had the distinct impression that she could choose to turn the entire featureless plane into whatever she wanted and make it look as real as she wanted, but that she was not yet ready to do so. <BR>
<BR>
I felt calm and relaxed and reassured that although I was just touching the outskirts of her reality, more would be revealed with time. (Afterwards I did not tell the others I was with about this part as it all seemed so dreamlike and I thought (illogically) at the time: 'Maybe I just imagined it' - I personally found it quite hard to talk about what it was all like. I had a relatively paranoid sense that the others would think I was making stuff up - Hell, I wasn't even sure I believed it myself!!)<BR>
<BR>
I opened my eyes again and saw the sky and leaves of a tree above me (consensual reality this time), but the sight was too overwhelming, so I closed my eyes and returned briefly to the plane. I could feel the 'journey' ending now and felt very calm and relaxed, but also a bit nervous that the others would not believe what had happened. <BR>
<BR>
When I opened my eyes again, I was back in consensual reality. I felt like the episode lasted maybe 30 minutes, but I was told that I had been 'out' for about 4-5 minutes. I felt very weary / heavy for about an hour afterwards and we had to eat sweets and stuff to remove the strange taste from our mouths. After around 2 hours I felt I was okay to drive, but I still took it real slow. <BR>
<BR>
This stuff cleans up nicely. It left me clear headed and with a sense that I had gained some sort of glimpse at a universe far bigger than I could have imagined. I had a very slight headache afterwards, although I am not sure that was from the Salvia or something else (I often have mild headaches).<BR>
<BR>
Although I have given a pretty straight-forward trip report, I can't put into words the sheer 'weirdness' of this herb. Nothing could have prepared me for it.
