I have no previous psychedelic experience and decided that Salvia was a cool enthogen to start with.<BR>
<BR>
Yesterday I bought a vial of 5x extract from a dutch smartshop. I wasnt really sure what to expect, though I had read a lot of experiences.<BR>
I came over to some friends and loaded up a simple wooden pipe with 50mg.<BR>
<BR>
I lit it and pulled heavily. I felt nothing but some weird stonedness and decided that the pipe just wasnt powerful enough. <BR>
<BR>
So I stuffed 150mg of the extract in a homemade waterpipe. I sucked it all in one big toke and hold it in for about 20 sec.<BR>
<BR>
Then I lost control.<BR>
<BR>
I started talking weird shit, appearently I was trying to explain what I were seeing. My friend were turning into weird shapes that became boats and floated away. Every vision I was seeing was very quick and disappeared very fast. <BR>
<BR>
I was in total chaos but enjoying the ride. Things got really weird and I completly forgot I smoked a substance called salvia. <BR>
<BR>
My mind was twisted and bent and an entity came up to me and said 'relax dude'. So I tried to listen to what he said, but my mind kept on racing. Wicked patterns took control and I only could see my hallucinations.. nothing else.<BR>
<BR>
I started to worry how long I would be fucked up, but that was a sign of being able to control my thoughts.<BR>
<BR>
Then the father of one of my friends got real mad and started screaming to a guy called Robin.  We all got nervous and I walked outside the house, still mildly tripping. It was about T+0:20. I drove home and was sober when I arrived home.
