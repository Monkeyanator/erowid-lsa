MDMA Protocol<BR>
<BR>
Night prior (8-12 hours prior to ingestion): 1 Prozac, 20mg<BR>
<BR>
Morning on waking: 4-5 Cal-Mg tablets. (Must be CHELATE: Not Dolomite or<BR>
Oyster Shell) and 50 - 100mg 5-HTP<BR>
<BR>
Ingestion: 2-3 Cal-Mg tablets<BR>
<BR>
Booster: 2-3 Cal-Mg tablets. 50 - 100 mg 5-HTP<BR>
<BR>
4hrs after Ingestion: 1 Prozac, 20mg<BR>
<BR>
Remarks:<BR>
<BR>
Cal-Mg is best absorbed as Chelate. Takes 8 hours for Carbonate (Dolomite).<BR>
Total dose is about 2 RDAs, not very much. Eliminates Jaw Chattering. Also<BR>
note, that the Jaw is the primal expressive organ for all  chordates, and<BR>
serotonin very applicable. Full leeches given serotonin then double their<BR>
blood load. Knowing this paradoxically lessens jaw problems, part of psych<BR>
prep for new users (sez my foaf).<BR>
<BR>
Prozac reduces tendency to clench and grind jaw. Considerably molllifies<BR>
the wiped out feeling for the day after. Have no reports re other SSRIs<BR>
such as Zoloft.<BR>
<BR>
5-HTP lenghens the return time, much smoother and lasts longer. Seems to<BR>
allow learning to be absorbed better.<BR>
<BR>
Note that side effects curve is steep, try 20mg less and you may have much<BR>
less of them.<BR>
<BR>
PS. This protocol is very effective and known to work well.
