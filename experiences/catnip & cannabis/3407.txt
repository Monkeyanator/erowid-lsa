I am a college student and really into herbal medicine.  I use st. johns wort everyday for depression and occasionally valerian root to help me sleep. I decided to try catnip one friday afternoon after smoking a lot of weed every night for a week, i had read that it was good for digestion and for colds, one of which i had been fighting all week without too much luck.  The marijauna was doing little more than make me jittery and cough a lot. <BR>

I bought two ounces of dry cut catnip at a local headshop and proceeded to go home and make some tea. it had been about three hours since i had smoked with my friends and i was down and pleasantly relaxed, i filled up my diffuser and brewed the tea for about fifteen minutes, more time would probably make it stronger but i dont know.  Before i had even finished the cup of tea i was beginning to feel very calm and relaxed, laughing a lot just like a good mellow pot buzz.  its not as visionary as smoking pot is for me, but i can say that for a decent tasting tea (with a peppermint in the bottom for taste) it has a very nice effect.  I would suggest it to anyone who really likes a good mellow high. peace..
