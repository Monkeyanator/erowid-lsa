I decided to try the TFMPP that I just got. I've never experimented with this substance before.<BR>
<BR>
11pm 90mg of TFMPP down the hatch. Relaxed mindset, comfortable home setting.<BR>
<BR>
11:10 decide to take 1g GHB to supplement the experience<BR>
      <BR>
11:40 well, I guess it was way past my bedtime, because what would have ordinarily been an average to small dose of G made me more pleasantly sleepy than normal. I let myself drift off for a little while, while watching a boring movie.<BR>
<BR>
12:30am wake up, still altered, but buzzing from something more than just GHB. I feel my teeth buzzing. A cursory look in the mirror reveals dilated pupils. Yup, this is definitively more than GHB.<BR>
      <BR>
2:00am Very uncomfortable body load. Significant nausea that never leads to vomiting. I am definitively high, quite anxious, bright colors everywhere, but that's it. No significant psychological alteration. I want this to be over. Also occasional stomach cramping.<BR>
       <BR>
3:00am I am reminded of the rough ride I had the first time I did 5-MeO-DiPT. However, the two events, while similar, bear significant differences: 1- the foxy made me nauseous only in the beginning of the trip. Now I am nauseous throughout. 2- While both substances have a mellow trippiness aspect to them, the foxy is significantly more psychologically   interesting. 3- the foxy made me feel wired and erotic. the TFMPP is making me feel wired and toxic.<BR>
<BR>
4:00am(ish) some normal body feelings are occasionally peeping through the sensation of being ill.<BR>
            <BR>
5:00am(ish) closer to normal state. am starting to feel sleepy again albeit, still quite toxic. fall asleep shortly after the 5am mark. this is the t+6hr point.<BR>
<BR>
8:00am wake up very groggy. I usually wake up, even after only a couple of hours of sleep and a night of partying, able to coordinate my movements. Well, this morning, when the phone rang, I was so tired and half asleep, that I had trouble reaching for the receiver. EEK! Never again.<BR>
<BR>
12:00pm feeling less hung over, almost normal, although I think I will wait before trying this one again until more is known about it. My brain is screaming 'I need a vacation'.
