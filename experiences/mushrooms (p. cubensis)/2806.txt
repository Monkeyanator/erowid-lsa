Around 9pm on a Saturday night, I decided to eat 4 grams of cubensis mushrooms. At first, I felt like the room was dancing around me and by about 10pm, I felt like evey negative aspect of my life was in my face. I was going through a divorce, had a bad term in college, and had just moved into my own place. I thought that this uneasy feeling would pass, but after 2 hours into the trip, I felt as if I was 'freaking out'. I fell to the floor crying, feeling as if I was one step away from losing my mind. I started counting from 10 to 1 on a piece of paper. All I wanted was for the trip to be over. I laid on the floor by the stereo and listened to all of the music and background noise blend into one sound. By about 3am, I started to feel better. By 4:30pm, I was falling asleep on the floor. I don't blame the mushrooms for my bad trip, they only intensified my mood at the time. Before taking another psychadelic, I will evaluate my mood to avoid repeating this scenario.
