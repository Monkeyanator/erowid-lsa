3 weeks and 5 days ago I started 24 jars in the PF Tek method.  About 5 days ago I gave 22 of the 24 jars their 'Birthday' (two of them were lost due to bacteria) and have been amazed at how quickly they have grown.  Just this morning I had to pick about four smaller sized specimens due to their almost complete opening of the cap (afraid of letting spores drop on the other cakes).  I have already innoculated 24 more jars... I will keep you all updated and tell about my first trip on my homegrown mushrooms...<BR>

NOTE:  This was SOOOO easy to start and maintain.  I received everything from a friend, including spore prints, but in researching, it couldn't cost more than $100 for EVERYTHING I have including ordering spore syringes from Psilocybe Finaticus.  I reccomend anyone interested in trying this out... I mean $100 for an ENDLESS supply of experimentation into the Psychedelic realm...
