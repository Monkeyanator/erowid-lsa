This little experiment began with a homestead kit I had bought from a local head store.  Don't do this.  It was a waste of $85.  PF is the man, and his stuff is cheap.  So I jacked the spores from the homestead kit, and then tried a modified PF/magic mushroom growers guide technique.  I made a syringe with the homestead spores, and all the cakes turned a fuzzy white, that proceded into a forest green.  I don't trust homestead spores.  <BR>

I then sent away for some PF spores, and redid the jars, this time baking all the ingredients in the oven, before mixing into the jars to sterilize again.  Something here worked, and my guess is the spores.  They looked much healthier, a brighter white, more threadlike, less fuzzy, and they didn't turn green.  Grew much faster too.  About two weeks in the jar for the fastest specimens.  I got nine cakes out of twelve, but two of the three I lost were to some extraction experiments, not to contamination.  The terrarium consisted of an ultrasonic I got at Target for about fourty bucks.  Screw the chains of bottles like in the MMGG, instead, take one bottle, turn it on it's side, and cut a circle in the side, which fits over the cap on the humidifier.  The normal opening of the bottle was just at the level of the terrarium, above the drip shield.  And no timer.  I just stuffed a piece of cotton in the bottle to keep from having to refill it twice a day.  And another added touch was some weather stripping around the edge of the ice chest.  I have two gauges in it, but they seem unneccessary, the conditions stay very close to 75 degrees and 95 percent humidity when it's in a room at close or just under normal room temperature.  Anyway, the cakes spent two weeks before heavy fruiting, but yeilded about three quarters of an ounce dry in less than a month.  <BR>

Two trips later, I must say that there seems to be no contaminant, a very giggly trip, with mad visuals.  3g was way too much.  Two should be more than sufficient for a serious trip (ego disolution, empathy, mad geometric patterns and morphing).  Very fun, ridicoulously easy.  Just wipe down before you work, and go with the good spores.
