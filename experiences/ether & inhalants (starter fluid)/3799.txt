<span class='erowid-warning'>[Erowid Note: 
The "water extraction" method is ineffective in separating diethyl ether from the volatile hydrocarbon liquids/gases in "starter fluid". Our understanding of the literature is that there is no such thing as safe use of volatile hydrocarbon gases: their psychoactive effects are inseparable from nerve and organ damage.]</span><br>

I had some starting fluid, it only seemed like the good thing to do, so I derived the ether from it using water.  I got into my bed and soashed the blue rag in the smelly brown stuff.  I quickly huffed all the fumes as it was on my face, 'quick! quick! it'll evaporate!' I said to myself.  Soon enough it did and I took it away from my face.  I layed there in amazement as my body was in an INTENSE tingle and I felt my mind fall into the Void.  I saw purple fuzzy dots all over the lens of my eye, then, they all danced together and formed a huge eye looking at me!  It lasted just a couple of minutes, then I fell asleep.  I don't see how people cannot get off on this stuff. This is definelty recommended!
