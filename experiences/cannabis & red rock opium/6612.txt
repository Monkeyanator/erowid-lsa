I just finished reading a erowid.org report on red rock opium. Seeing how i bought a gram of it last night, i decided to read up on it to see what i had boughten. The report said that red rock opium was not opium at all, and had no pyschoactive effects. So i went upstairs and crushed the red rock into a powder then placed it in a bowl with some bud from the OZ i just bought.<br>
<br>
After smoking the bowl i could definately detect another presence beyond the marijuana. So then i came downstairs and started reading the only other report on red rock opium and cannabis, http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php3?ID=3506. The report talked of all the things that i felt too...<br>
<br>
'The opium high was subtle, but definitely there. A positive mood lift was one of the most defining<br>
     factors of the experience--it was entirely too strong and forcing to be attributed to the marijuana. The only<br>
     other affects that could be attributed fully and only to the opium was a noticable, yet subtle, feeling of<br>
     euphoria. It was quite different from a marijuana euphoria--it kicked in about 20 minutes after ingestion and<br>
     plateaued for about 2 hours. The opium also gave me a feeling that seemed familar to me when on<br>
     opioids--my interest in anything and everything but myself and my friend had started to dwindle, seemingly<br>
     replaced with a warm feeling all about me and in me. However, not enough of the substance was ingested<br>
     to feel any pin point numbness. Other affects I noticed were intoxication (giddyness, a light headed feeling,<br>
     mental cloudiness) and poor short term memory. Both of which could be credited to either the ganj, opium,<br>
     or a mixture of both. '<br>

 While Red Rock Opium may not be opium, its still pretty cool. =)
