I have used Adderall off and on for my whole Senior year but the thing I hate is that I can't dose two days in a row because the 2nd day it is as if I have a years worth of tolerance and barely get a twinge in my pinky finger.<BR>
<BR>
So I went a whole 2 weeks without doing any drugs whatsoever except for caffenie pills a few times to get by.  So I got 4 of these orange Adderall pills for $10 and took them right before first hour (math, this was also the largest dose I had done) and just sat through waiting for the effects to kick in and was pleasantly suprised after about 25 min when I started to notice life moving a little faster.  I stared at the board and as each minute passed I grew more understanding of all those letters and numbers on the board.  I started taking notes (I noticed that my hand-writing was so good looking, so neat and perfectly spaced and written on the paper), but no one else was, I tried to write down every word the teacher was saying but got mad that my hand wasn't going as fast as my mind.  I felt as if grades were the most important thing to me.  I was talking up a storm with the girl next to me and constantly drinking my bottle of water. (Knowing that i drink about 5x as much while on Adderall than normal, being H2O deprived is not fun)<BR>
<BR>
As soon as class was over I was the first one to jump up and ran througout the halls greeting people I have never met and talking continously with my friend next to me who was wanting to try Adderall from what I was saying about it.  <BR>
<BR>
I ran into my 2nd hour class and began just reading through the chapter we were on and answering questions we were on, It is like Adderall turns you into a bookworm/nerd, my friends were joking around as I usually do and I was like 'Hey stop messing around and do your work guys!' It was so odd to hear those words come out of my mouth.  <BR>
<BR>
I noticed my leg was jerking really bad when I sat down and I couldnt control it, It got kind of annoying because it was shaking my whole body and I couldnt write straight, I was also chewing on my nails a lot, and it started hurting because they were worn down to the skin, and I was constantly biting the inside of my mouth taking little chunks off because it was so amusing.<BR>
<BR>
I had to pee really bad though and this continued about every 45-60 where I got a strong onset to pee really bad.  I went throughout the day feeling like a champion, I get Euphoria almost exact to 10mg of Oxycodone, and have a mild body high comparable to MDMA and I was talkative like coke, I was VERY impressed that a perscription drug can be so wonderous! <BR>

This drug can make you nicer to people, do better in school/work, and overall a more productive member of society - What is so wrong with that?<BR>
Those kids with ADHD are so damn lucky ;)<BR>

The Pos effects GREATLY outweigh the negative of this drug and highly recommend those people who underestimate the power of 'legal' drugs.
