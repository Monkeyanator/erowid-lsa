This is my ongoing experience with crack. I first tried crack with my present day wife. I had just met her and I went to her house. I knew she smoked pot, but what happend next shocked me. She asked if I wanted to get high. I thought she wanted to smoke a joint or something so I said yes. She led me into her room. She opened a drawer and pulled out a box, inside was a glass pipe, and a vial of crack. I was shocked to see this. She took out the pipe and placed a crack rock inside, and took her lighter and gently heated it. She then placed it in her mouth, and proceeded to inhale a white smoke, exhaling slowly with her eyes closed and her eyes rolling back into her head. At that time I was thinking man is she hot. As she was exhaling she handed me the pipe and lighter and just stared into my eyes. I couldnt resist her temptation, she was a hot black girl, basically the girl of my dreams. I then thought how bad could it be if she smokes crack, shes a small pretty little black girl, it cant be that bad. So I took a hit, and immediatley I felt like Ive never felt before, I then passed it back to her and she loaded up another piece of crack, and we smoked the day away.That was 3 years ago, and that girl is now my wife, and we both still smoke crack. I love her alot and I love smoking crack with her, but i wonder what I could have made of myself if that night never occured.
