This friday I wanted to do something wierd, so at about 7.30 AM I took two 10mg tablets of the antidepressant Tryptizol on an empty stomach. After my breakfast, approx. 7.50 AM, I took two more tablets together with my allergy medication (a very mild one called Clarityn). Then I headed off for school.<BR>
<BR>
After my first class I began to feel a bit tired (this was around 9 AM), and went for a walk around the school grounds. My legs seemed to operate without me thinking about it.<BR>
<BR>
The second class (maths) wasn't very fun. I felt sleepy and worn out. I couldn't concentrate on the book or the teacher, and nearly fell asleep a couple of times. Finaly the class ended, and I could leave the classroom and take a walk along the corridors.<BR>
<BR>
When the third class began I felt like I hadn't slept in 36 hours. My eyes moved in a jerky manner, my mouth was dry and I couldn't keep my eyes open because then the light would hurt my dialated pupils. It was a biology class, and we were supposed to write about blood. The teacher sounded far off, and everything was black for periods (I don't know if I blacked out, fell asleep or just closed my eyes). When I began to write I lost my train of thought quite a few times. Sometimes I also wrote the wrong words, and I had some strange dream-hallucinations (right before I fall asleep I sometimes get strange ideas and see things that aren't happening). The girl who sat next to me asked if I've been smoking weed, probably because I looked wierd and mumbled strange things.<BR>
<BR>
In some way, I managed to get through the class, even succeeding in dissecting a heart while half asleep and sometimes nodding off. When I got home at 12 AM I fell asleep the moment I laid down on my couch and slept deeply for three hours.<BR>
<BR>
All in all, a _very_ strange trip.  To do it in school was pretty stupid, since I couldn't get much done. Maybe if I had combined the Tryptizol with Adderall or caffeine it could be a more exciting thing. Something to try next time...
