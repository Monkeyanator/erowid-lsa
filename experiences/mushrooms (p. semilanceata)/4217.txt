<BR>
First I eat a large meal, then I wait 2 hours, this prevents stomach upset and excess gas. Next I extract 12 mushrooms (the standard recreational dose is 48) [erowid note: this is done in the U.K. and these mushrooms are<BR>
psilocybe semilanceata] and add them to a saucepan along with 1 cup of boiling water. I boil the mushrooms for 5-10 minutes (the illegal part) then strain them out and bin them. Next I consume a large glass of whiskey. The whiskey both induces a headache, and eliminates any feelings of apprehension caused by ingesting the Psilocybin solution.<BR>
<BR>
Finally I drink the solution slowly, over a 15 minute period, to prevent any disorientation. The mushrooms kick in when the headache is going full blast. There is a sudden feeling of 'ooh that's better' and then no more headache.<BR>
<BR>
No more headaches for at least 12 months in my case. There are no psychosomatic side effects to speak of, apart from once when I had a giggle fit...
