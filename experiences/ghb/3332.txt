My experiences have been both great and uncomfortable. We (group of 12 friends) have an excellent source of GHB and are always guarenteed of the correct dosage. Initially 2g's were perfect for me with a 1.5g top up 2-3 hours later, this to ensure a pleasant state, hightened senses and sociability. Almost overnight however, I developed a very strange reaction to the GHB. No matter how small the dosage that I'd take, a reaction would set in +/- 2hours later, resulting in severe nausea and drowsiness. One theory is that I have developed an allergy to the salt solution that it is mixed in, another is that the allergy is to the GHB itself.<BR>

The latter is unlikely as when combined with 'e' or 'a' - although a much smaller dose, the effects are only enjoyable with little or no after effects. As a matter of fact, the after effects of the GHB are usually ones of elatedness and sociability unlike other substances.<BR>

The only adverse side effect (other than my specific reaction) experienced has been a change of sleeping patterns and occasionally lack of sleep altogether.
