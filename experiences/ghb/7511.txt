Less than a week after graduating from high school, me and my friend decided to use up the GHB we had saved for about a month.  We each started with 1 cap, or about 1 oz. The effects set in around 15-20 minutes later.  We were immediately satisfied.  We were stmbling around, laughing at everything. <BR>
<BR>
We exerienced global confusion.  We had a conversation about the level of our confusion.  We came to the consensus that we could understand every word that was coming out of a person's mouth, but for the life of us, could not put them together into a coherent and cohesive sentence.  We were very dizzy and failed miserably, every single field sobriety test that we tried to administer to each other.<BR>
<BR>
We also both experienced mild euphoria, and noticed that we were in generally good moods.<BR>
<BR>
20 or so minutes into the trip, we decided that we were ready for more.  My companion took another whole cap, while I myself got greedy and decided to ingest another full cap.  Approximately 20 minutes later, the second cap hit me, and hard.  Confusion increased considerably.  I remember sitting down on a bike rack and that is all i remember for the next 3 hours.  I awoke in the hopspital with an IV, nasal trumpet, and heart monitors.  Apparently, I had gone completely catatonic and unresponsive. My breathing becamse shallow and my pulse rate dropped for 59.<BR>
<BR>
I began drooling after my friend and some other friends dragged me to a nearby friend's house.  After an hour the paramedics were called, and I was admitted to the hospital.  They administered narcane, which made me throw up, and kept me up all night, but had no other effects.  After about 4 horus of administering the drug, all the effects were gone, and i was right as rain.  However, my buddy got popped for possession of the half empy vial.<BR>

Word to the wise: GHB can be fun, but it's unpredictable.  Never do it alone without a sitter.
