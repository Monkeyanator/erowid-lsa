My friend decided to give me a dose of GHB the other day.  I have taken it before and slightly overdosed one other time.  This time however was quite different.  I took a little over a teaspoon and was feeling pretty good about 20 minutes later.  I felt happy, everything was great, nothing seemed wrong, and somewhat dizzy.  The walls kept moving on me...But at the time it seemed almost like a challenge to walk.<BR>

Anyways, about an hour and a half later I decided that I wanted to take more.  I took my friends bottle and poured more powder into my drink.  I didn't realize how much it was until I started feeling effects only 10 minutes later.  I realized then I took about 2-3 teaspoons on top of the other teaspoon I had consumed earlier.  10 minutes after taking my G, I felt rather dizzy and couldn't keep my head up very well.  I was also feeling rather tingly all over and I think someone could have probably punched me and I wouldn't have known.  Within 1/2 hour I was feeling incredibly awful and sick.  I felt as though I had to vomit and my mouth was watering way too much.<BR>

I insisted on driving to pick up my friend from school and on my way there started to vomit. I threw up only a couple of times.  I sat on the curb at Hardee's in the parking lot and continued to feel messed up.  I got back in the car after a few minutes of gathering myself together and continued to drive.  It was incredibly hard and do not recommend it to anyone.  I felt awful and after I picked my friend up I went back to my house and passed out for 3 hours.  When I woke up my stomache felt a little ill, but after being awake for 1/2 hour or so I felt fine.<BR>
