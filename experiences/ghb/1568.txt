The other night I got off work and took 1 cap/2.3g of G. The first hadnt kicked at all in 1 hour so I took another cap, total 4.6g. Me and a freinds watched TV, socialised, ect., they were drinking alcohol. I had a great time, the dose was perfect. I was very talkitive, everything was funnier, and I had lots energy. <BR>
<BR>
At least 2 hours after the initial dose I took 1/2 cap more, total 5.8g on the way to a club. The extra 1.2 grams was enough to shut me down! Once we got to the club the new dose started to take hold. I started to talk and dance less and less until I was sitting on the floor with my hands on my head. Thats when we left. <BR>
<BR>
On the way back I started to get what felt like electric shocks through my body. I have felt these before on G, but these were much worse. I'd get a 'shock' and nearly trip when walking. I was unable to communicate even what I felt like to my friend. As I continued to walk home I started to get what felt like a sudden lose of consiouness with the shocks. Then, while I was walking, I would lose consciouness and start walking off in some weird direction. It felt like the world was blacking out then I was walking in a dark tunnel. Sometimes I would have a dream too and lose all concept of who or where I was. Then I would snap out of to my friend asking me where I was going. I wanted to stop the whole way back but my friend made me walk all the way home. <BR>

Once home I passed out and woke up the next morning. I remembered most of the night only after being reminded by friends. I learned the hard way that more isnt better with G!
