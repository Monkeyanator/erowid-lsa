A groups of friends gathered at our local hangout and decided that we were growing bored with what was up and one of my guy friends introduced us to the drug GHB.  He said that it was great and he'd taken it before so we trusted him.  Well he wasn't a pharmacist and didn't know know how much should be given.  There were two girls in the group, myself being one.  We left to go somewhere private to take it and the guy I was seeing at the time told me he would take care of me if anything strange happened I couldn't handle. When we returned to the club another girlfriend of ours was tripping pretty hard and we had to rush her home.  In the excitement, I used bad judgement and drove.  About half way home I felt a hard rush such as one you would get when you take too many shots too fast.  It felt like my head spun around.  <BR>

Shortly after getting her home I felt the nausea start.  I had severe dry heaves and the only way to make them stop was to lie down.  I had strong sexual urges which would have been alot more interesting if I could get past the sickness I was feeling.  When I felt like I could get up and walk my guy friend threw me over his shoulders and put me in the car, poured me on my sofa at my house and proceeded on his way.  I immediately passed out not knowing anything that was going on around me.  I was totally oblivious, anything could have happened but luckily I was with someone special and he didn't take advantage of the situation.  I woke about three hours later feeling better but for a couple of weeks I had trouble concentrating or maintaining a complete train of thought. My only advice is never to trust anyone where drugs are concerned.  If you insist on doing drugs stick to what u know!!!!!
