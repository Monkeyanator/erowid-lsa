I have just got out of rehab. today because of my addiction to GHB.  I was the first person in the history of that recovery program to have admitted myself in for GHB use.  It's true GHB helps you feel better about yourself but if you feel down all the time and GHB is around to help, then your going to do more, right?  I was doing between 2 and 15 cap-fulls a day.  <BR>

Well I tried coming off but after 2 days I went back to it.  This time I'm going to use it in moderations.  The withddrawl effects were the shakes and sleeplessness.  GHB is addictive and should not be taken to lightly.  Be careful when using this drug.
