I first encountered GHB while buying weed from a man that based his operation out of an abandoned screen printing shop. He had set up a lab to synthesize the wonder-drug from microcircuitry-grade GBL and lye. Instead of buying the 1/8th I intended to buy, I bought a half cup for $15. I downed three teaspoons immediately and walked back to a local cafe. Once there I felt the promised euphoria. Everything was slow yet exciting. I became very fond of the chemical and a very open user of it. I carried a bottle of it with me at all times. I would often spike drinks out in the open. At that place, nobody really cared. I found myself drawn to the opposite sex in the most profound way. I cuddled with friends and occasionally had sex with some of them while under the influence of good ol' Gamma.<BR>

After about three months of spinning more and more down the tube I got a job as a software engineer in a town about two hours away from my old hangout. I had a quart delivered to me for $150 but shortly thereafter, my dealer got busted. I don't know for sure, but I think he had enough chemicals to synthesize a fishtank full of GHB when the cops found him. He ended up getting off the hook due to a witty lawyer but they took all of his equipment. Now I have less than three doses left and they'll be gone soon; effectively ending my GHB days. I've had some good experiences and some bad ones. It's made as happy as could be on some occasions and extremely suicidal on others.<BR>

I found it to be a social drug and I don't like to do it alone.  Doing GHB without someone else around (preferably someone of the opposite sex) is dangerous. It makes me feel very lonely and petty. When I do it in a crowd and I feel great and benefit from the wonderful possibilities the drug offers. (Warning: It's easy to overdose on GHB. I always know what the concentration is and how much is a good dose for my bodyweight. It took me quite a long time to develop a good sense of how much is the proper dose for a particular person. Most GHB tastes disgusting due to the byproduct of NaCl (salt) produced in the reaction. GHB should be chemically neutral however, not changing yellow litmus paper).
