At around 9 in my room, in almost darkness, straight after having the K I smoked (quickly) the Salvia in my bong. I lay back and what happened was incredible.<BR>
<BR>
I was rolled up into a line, which was then rolled up into a point (which was everything in the universe at once). From there I was shown (by 'god') how the entire universe was unfolded and how each person is an extension of a far greater 'hyper' being. This all happened in about 3 minutes. As it finished I found myself in my room again, rather stunned, but feeling fine (with normal K effects again). It left me feeling very happy about myself, as I am now not afraid of death, having had the very strong feeling of being part of better, greater being.<BR>
<BR>
I will do it again, probably tonight, as I felt that more would have allowed me to move around and interact more with the higher dimension I was in. Before I was only in it observing the normal world and being able to affect that, but not the 'space' I was in. I also feel that 'god' was trying to explain something more to me and I wanna know what it is.<BR>

PS: I am not an experienced tripper, having only been taking drugs for a couple of years.
