Recently I ordered some 6x enhanced leaves off the Internet.  It arrived yesterday  resembling finely chopped dark tea leaves.  I put a little marijuana at the bottom of my bowl, as to prevent the salvia choppings from falling through into the chamber.  I packed in enough Salvia for 3 hits or so (totally eyeballed) and got down to business.  <BR>
<BR>
I smoked the three or so hits (more like two biggish ones and two smallish ones)  and slithered over to the bed, ready for it to come up fast, which it did.<BR>

I felt . . . ok, you know in the matrix, when keanu reeves touches the mirror and the silver mercury-esque liquid metal travels up his arm and then you see it come up from his neckline and slowly envelope his head. . . well it was just like that, except it started in my neck and was much less scary, actually very enjoyable.  My mental state was reasonably focused, I was still aware of where/who I was, and also aware that I was not experiencing the 'dream world' effects.  <BR>
<BR>
Salvia gave me some very subtle OEV's (light patterns, slight ambient lighting) and decently clear CEV's.  Also my body felt wonderful, not unlike being VERY VERY stoned, almost like the after effects of a nitrous inhale.  <BR>

I enjoyed it very much, even though it didn't reach the highest plateaus.  I am definately looking foward to trying it again, and smoking a little more next time, trying to hold it in for the longest possible time while at the same time maximizing smoke intake/volume per hit.  I am also considering purchacing some of the liquid 10x extract (Daniel Siebert's Sage Goddess Emerald Essence).  <BR>

Conclusion: I loved the peep show, but I'm ready to go get a prostitute.
