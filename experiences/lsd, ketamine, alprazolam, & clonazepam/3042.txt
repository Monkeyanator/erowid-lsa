Phish rules to begin with.  Tripping to their music is an out of body experience.<BR>

The pharmies were just for fun, god knows what they actually did.  The acid and k put me in to the warp zone.  I had such abstract thoughts that made complete sense at the time.  And the dancing, could not stop for my life.  Michael Rey a jazz trumpeter got on stage and went nuts dancing like Jim Morrison with his indian dream figures.  Then he started playing.  It was fucking out of control.  Best Sex ever.  Heaven is a place on earth.  <BR>

PPS.   Drugs are fun... be careful not to have too much fun to often and you fall down the stairs and gash your knee open
