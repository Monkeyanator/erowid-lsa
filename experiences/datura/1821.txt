I Have Just Had a Friend pick a bag of the Trumpet Like Plants, Which Has Been Identified as Datura. I boiled all except for the Flowers of it, and drank it, Everything Went Blurry, I could not see in front of my face, Let alone take Customers at my Job, I ended up going home and Spent the next 4 or so Hour sitting around my house Jumping at anything that was in my periphral vision that was Moving, also my motor movements went to shit, and I Kind of Felt like I was Floating, There was really intense Visuals But I still had the feeling i had a grasp on Life. In the middle and still as of Now, I am suffering of Amnesia, Not remember what I even had to eat....
