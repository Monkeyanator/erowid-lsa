Whoa..... that's how I shall preface this.  Just last week was the first time I had even heard of this stuff.  The person who gave me the seeds told me the story of the soldiers at Jamestown, and I thought 'wow, I have to try this crap!' Now, I am no novice drug user, I've pretty much tried EVERYTHING, but I don't think I was prepared for the 'stinkweed trip.'  OK< I had about 11 grams of Jimson weed seeds, so I ground them all up into a powder almost. Initially I tried to smoke a pinch or two in my bowl, this didn't seem to have any effect, so I began to eat it in gram increments, I would wait about 20 minutes and then eat another gram. Nothing seemed to happen, although I did start to feel a bit floaty, and my peripheral vision was blurred and full of motion that didn't really exist.<BR>

At this point I was very disappointed, so I went to bed. Well, evidently it takes longer to kick in than I expected, because when I got up to go to the bathroom about two hours later, my motor functions did NOT exist at all, I fell at least two dozen times, and ran into EVERY piece of furniture in existence in my apartment.  I broke at least one toe, cracked two ribs and bruised my tailbone, let alone the scrapes and bruises on my forearms, knees and buttocks. I also was talking gibberish, according to my mother, with whom I live, and Whom I scared shitless during this event.  I walked into her bedroom at 5:30 am and began rummaging around, when she woke and asked what I was doing I replied 'relax....' and then let loose a ten minute stream of gibberish, which I felt made perfect sense.  I also had in depth conversations with myself, although I cannot remember what the hell about.  I imagine I was still pretty fucked up for almost two days, I was unable to read small print as well until this afternoon (two days later) and I have finally stopped seeing weird movement in my peripheral vision.  <BR>

Aside from the injuries I sustained, I think I would try it again, in a smaller dose, and preferably WITH someone else, and most likely out doors, where there is no furniture or doorways to navigate. If you're considering trying this stuff, be wary, take small doses.
