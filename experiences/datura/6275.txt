I am a relative beginner to the drug scene.  My friends and I were trying for acid but ended up without it.  We checked erowid then went to Osh and bought about ten packs of datura seeds.  We ground them for maybe fifteen seconds, then steeped them for about two minutes in hot water.  3/4 teaspoon ground to one cup water.  We drank it and within twenty minutes we noticed a lack of balance and coordination.  After another few minutes things began to get weird.<br>

	We smoke about a bowl of good weed between three of us, but we didn't finish the whole thing on account of dry throats from the datura.  Almost immediately it was like being on an extremely intense marijuana high.  Everything moves in varying 'framerates'.  Light, but vivid hallucinations, and an almost acid like fuzziness and otherworldy experience.  No loss of memory or mental faculties though.  At some point I feel asleep with completely lucid dreams that were indistinguishable from reality.  I walked around the house talked to people even though I was making people do things by thought, until I realized I was still in bed.  It was so vivid I repeated the same thing scientifically five times or so to see if it was real or not.  I couldn't come to any conclusion.  I slept for maybe six hours and with great difficulty got out of bed.  However, once out everything was clear, and normal.  No pupil dilation, some dry throat, but otherwise normal.  If not a bit relaxed and clear headed.  For me it was definitely a pleasurable experience.
