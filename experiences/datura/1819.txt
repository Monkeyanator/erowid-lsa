Just to confirm this description of the effects of Jimson weed. During the early '70s a lot of people in my social circle tried Jimson Weed in the form of 'Surama' herbal cigarettes. Except they ate them instead of of smoking them. They all reported the effects described. One was unable to read fine print for two days. Another hallucinated a regiment of soldiers marching through his living room. A third stepped out of a country cottage and saw a Giant about to destroy the local town. He was so worried that he ran and warned the local police. Oh dear.
