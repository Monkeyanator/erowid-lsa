I have used Valium quite a few times.  It will always be part of my life.  It's a wonderful all-purpose drug.  I am very sensitive to any kind of drug and allergic to some (I can't even drink).  Valium is perfectly tolerated by my system.  2.5 mg is perfect if you need to get to sleep with out a 'hangover' the next day.  By hangover I mean it feels like it would be impossible to get out of bed, although once you do get up, you feel fine.  I have found no difference in quality of sleep in the higher doses, only more of the hangover effect.  <BR>

I have also found Valium to be useful for nausea.  I've taken 2.5mg for it, and it works quick and well.  <BR>

I do not know what dose it takes to trip out, but I don't think I could stay awake to find out.  I have taken some after being stoned, and I got the impression it wouldn't be a good combonation.  At least for me, I felt like if I had taken any more I might have gone on a bad trip.  I think I took maybe half a mg.  <BR>

Overall, I think this is a perfectly safe drug to experiment with.
