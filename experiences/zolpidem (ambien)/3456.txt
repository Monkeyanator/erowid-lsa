I have noticed (well, they're hard to miss) very unique experiences while on Ambien. I have even experimented with it, such as taking only 5mg or 50mg, and studying the effects on myself.<br>
<br>
The following are the observations I wrote down while on 40mg of Ambien:<br>
<br>
12:00am <br>
Took 40mg Ambien.<br>
<br>
12:30am <br>
Disconnected feeling.<br>
Foggy thoughts.<br>
Hallucinations begin, very acidic [referring to LSD].<br>
Mind gains ability to make inanimate objects, animate.<br>
Interaction with these animates in very weird ways, including conversation with and without spoken words.<br>
Unlike lsd, very little control over the experience.<br>
Entrance into whole different created world.<br>
Barely able to communicate these thoughts with others in 'outside world'.<br>
Music has its way with thoughts, especially trance and darkstep [these are types of electronica for those who dont know].<br>
Music molds thoughts and mind into new 'Mental Worlds'.<br>
<br>
1:30am<br>
Come back down into real world temporarily.<br>
sleepy, fatigued, but very awake.<br>
<br>
2:00am<br>
wandering around in a concious trance-like state.<br>
<br>
~2:00am - ~3:00am<br>
Memory Gap. [I recall realizing that I recalled nothing of that hour... sleep?]<br>
<br>
3:00am<br>
decided to go to sleep.<br>
<br>

I have noticed an increasing tolerance to ambien, for now just to use it as a sleep aid alone, I must take 20mg (normal dosage is only 10mg).<br>
I suggest that if one decides to use Ambien recreationally (just something to get fucked up on) do not use it often. Tolerance builds up quicker than anything I have yet encountered, including ecstasy (MDMA) and LSD.
