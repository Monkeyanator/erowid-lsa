For quite a while, I've been trying to get my psychiatrist to prescribe me pharms that lend the user a more interesting experience (or have some street value).  Aderall, Ritalin, Dexadrine - all of that sends me into psychosis.  I'm bipolar, so I have to stay away from a lot of drugs, much to my chagrin.  At least I got some fun in before I had to quit.<BR>

Anyway, I had pretty much given up on the effort.  I couldn't even get any Xanax or Klonopin.  But I brought up that I had been having trouble sleeping, and my doctor prescribed Ambien for me.  Ambien is not a benzodiazapine like Xanax or Klonopin but it acts on the receptors in your brain in almost exactly the same way. The first couple of times I used it, I wasn't aware of what I could do to manipulate the medication so as to have a more enjoyable time.  But quickly, I learned that if I stayed up through the pleasant sleepy feeling that the drug gave me, things got a bit more interesting.  My sense of depth perception was really fucked up; really, my entire vision was - things were moving around and pulsating, etc.  I was impressed.  Ambien gave a high unlike any other I had previously - it was simultaneously drunken and clear-headed.  Overall it was a really pleasant experience, and I have since continued to use it.
