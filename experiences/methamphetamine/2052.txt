About four weeks ago, I experienced methamphetamine for the first time. I acquired a large amount of money and decided to buy some weed and something new, something I've never used before I chose methamphetamine. I gave the money to my dealer on a Wednesday and by Friday I had a nice half gram of crank, and about a 20 sack of quality weed. When Ryan (my dealer) gave me the shit at lunch he asked if he could have a line, I wanted to save it till I got home but I said okay. We went into the bathroom and I pulled out the bag to look at it, it was a white powder with small crystals with a mild bitter taste. Ryan began crushing the crystals and then made two good size lines. I rolled up a dollar bill and snorted my line, the first thing I noticed was the burning sensation in my nose but that passed quikly. <BR>

As I was waiting for Ryan to do his line (I accidently bumped the surface of what we sniffed it off and Ryan had to carve out the line again) I felt a growing feeling of stimulation and pleasure. We left the bathroom, by the time we got back to the lunch room it was time to go to class. I sat down at my table in art class and began concentrating on the effects of this drug. I felt a great sense of well-being,and stimulation. I was more talkative than usual then all the people that sit with me left, if they had stayed I probably would have talked alot. I was full of energy I started doing my art work faster and better. I soon abandoned my work to further explore this substance. For the rest of the class period I felt like I was on top of the world i felt like I could run miles and not get tired I felt I could take on the world. When school was over I did the rest of my crank and weed over the afternoon and till 2:30 am that night, but that's another story.
