Well,yet another day has gone and i am still here unhappy ,unsure,and uncaring. I have been doing methamphetamin/crank since i was 13 im 20 now and i have spent 2 yrs in jail/rehab and the remainder an addict/dealer. I sell dope now and have been for 2 yrs. i have good money a nice house a nice car and a fucked up life. I now suffer from social anxiety i go nowhere, ever. when i do, i trip out and have to leave, the first time i got high it was great euphoric to the max not only the first time but for months after. Then there always came a time when i would have to quit...when it became forbidden like jail or pregnancy.  as soon as i had the opportunity i was destined to get high again. i understand its nobody's fault but my own, but the hardest thing ill ever have to do is quit this drug.  if i dont soon i know the consequences. <BR>

to all the readers who are thinking that im trippin about nothing at all and that you wont be like me. You are lying to your self. the only person you have in your life is you. dont lie to yourself, because if you become untrusting of you, youll have no one.
