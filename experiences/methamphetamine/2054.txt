With Crystal Methamphetamine in good supply in my neck of the woods, so when i came into contact with a 'cook' i really wasnt in much of shock. after barging deal i ended up with 3 grams of decent meth. i sold one didnt plan on using any until a close friend of mine ask if i would do some with her, i had never done it up till this point when i was taught how to dose and cut, then use the drug. Meth leaves a harsh smell and taste in your mouth and sinuses the feeling of the drug melting in your throat is as if you had a nose bleed after the drug takes affect you dont want to eat or drink yet you are hungry and thirsty.<BR>

after about 2 hours my high was almost gone and i was feeling run down and stressed out until the next line was served this line was bigger that my previous. i quickly snorted it and almost instanly felt better this time i was stronger and fast than before i felt as i could fly around the block everything was better the lights brighter my vision sharper, this cycle repeated until i ran out of the drug.<BR>

3 days after my first experience i had not taken a shower, eatin, or drank anything and by the time i was ready to sleep i couldnt, due to hallucinations that were boggin my mind down and down right scaring me, i finally had to smoke some marijuana and take 3 roboxin 750 mg tablets to get to sleep<BR>
<BR>
i find myself still affected by this drug, i sometimes get twitches i never had, i crave the drug on days that things are going bad, but i will never touch this drug again.<BR>
<BR>
i will stick to my Marijuana and every once in a while a shroom or 5.<BR>
<BR>
i would not recommend this drug to anyone it is very addictive.
