There is no drug like this drug. And I don't mean that in a good way. It started when I was 16. I was experimenting. It was that age where you want *something more* and in my case, I had to try every drug in order to find it. I did E. It was great, but a one time thing. I smoked weed, didn't like it too much. Did K, made me puke. And then, there was crystal.<BR>

Otherwise known as jib, meth, whatever. And as soon as I put it up my nose, there was no going back. It was a pure escape from everything. Walking around doing nothing, suddenly felt interesting and exciting. My whole body was racing, and so was my mind. And I instantly needed more. Eventually I was doing anywhere from 10 to 20 caps in a night. Every night. That's the 'fun' part of crystal. The not so fun part? The fact that after a month of using it, I weighed about 120lbs (I'm 5.11 & a girl). It was summer, yet I was as white as a ghost. People constantly thought I was anorexic. I had what they call 'jib bumps' or 'jib scars' all over my forehead. They are these huge, nasty, purple bumps that kind of resemble zits but aren't. I later learned that they are a result of the harsh chemicals trying to get through the body. And the worst part of crystal were the relationships I destroyed. The comedown from crystal is more destructive than any other drug I have done. (and yes I've done coke) it made me sooo angry at everything and everyone.<BR>

Whenever I had to be at home with my family, and I didn't have any, I would scream and yell at them, and basically lose it. I said so many hurtful things to them, and even though I've been clean for over a year, I'm still trying to repair everything I broke because of this drug.
