I'm 18 and live in England; that's all I'll say about me, but I tried methamphetamine, or whizz as its commonly known here for the first time last week.<BR>
<BR>
It was fairly late when I got hold of the deal, I was with a few mates and we'd just ran across an old friend who was now into dealing. We bought a bag each off him and decided to just take it strait away. We emptied the powder onto a credit card, and simply licked it off, followed by a hasty drink of water!<BR>
<BR>
30 minutes later the pubs had kicked out and we were all seated on a wall, no one seemed to be effected by the whizz except me! My leg was bouncing up and down like crazy and every time I tried to control it a rush went up my spine. The best way to describe it is like a low form of electricity tickling your body.<BR>
<BR>
We decided to walk home, and that's when I realised we were all having the same effect. One of us would suddenly arch our back, or start stroking our hair. It was a really cool sensation. Once home, we put on some music and that was it, the buzzes increased, the senses were lifted and we all just sat grinning madly at each other. <BR>

The next day I had work and I was surprised, that even though I had failed to sleep, I was wide awake and ready! I kept getting mild rushes all day. The only drawback I can think of, is it took 44 hours before my body decided to feel tired and grant me sleep. But that said, I'm taking more next week!
