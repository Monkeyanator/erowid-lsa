<!--reference to 'meanoil' last to final step in manufacturing, shooting that--><BR>

Let me start by saying I in no way advocate or endorse the use of any intervaneous drug by anyone. I had just turned seven-teen and where I grew up in Texas there wasnt much to do. I was smoking grass and had dropped shitty acid a couple of times before. Then an older friend asked me if I had ever 'done a shot' I had snoted some 'crank' by that time, but hated the burn (at first anyway). My friend was pretty heavy in 'cooking' and could get a form of the drug that was incredible to shoot. It was in the second to last reaction before they turned it to powder. They reffered to it as 'meanoil'. He prepared me a shot that was way more than I could handle before he pulled the needle out I was over-amped and laying on the floor although aware of the voices around me I was for all purposes out. Within 45sec I arose off the floor in one motion and I felt a feeling that was total euphoria everyone was amazed at how well I was maitaining.I tingled from head to toe and felt as if I were the number one engine on a 747 taking off. For the rest of the night I was happy and eclectic. I talked about things I rarely shared with anyone. I felt a creativeness that I had nevered felt before. I drew pictures of log cabins and forest scenes that should have taken hours I finished four in two hours. <BR>

Well two days later I crashed hard. That one night would lead to a twelve year addiction that would nearly cost me my freedom and more importantly my life. So remember experimenting is fine but never allow the drug become more important to you than feel that you are. Although still smoking (probably more than I should) I have fended off the urge for that 'speed rush' for nearly three years. But the urge is always there....
