Well I had been experimenting with many different chemicals since I came across the wonderful world of psychedelics, ketamine, LSD, salvia, DXM etc etc, with varying degrees of success, my recent exploration has been done with those strange fellas Hawaiian Baby Woodrose Seeds, here is my wisdom on my subject.<BR>
<BR>
The first time I tried HBWR was with five seeds, everyone was out and I knew I wouldn't be disturbed for atleast three hours which would leave enough time for the stuff people usually do on psychedelics, dancing, listening to music, laughing at walls, meditating, I'm sure most of you fellow psychonauts out there know what im talking about so I won't go on.<BR>
<BR>
Five seeds had been crushed several hours before into a fine powder, the powder was placed in a glass of warm water, stirred and left to sit in the sun for about three hours. The water had turned a kind of shitty pale white kind of colour with bits of crap floating about in it by the time  got back to it. I drank the mixture expecting it to taste foul, but it didn't taste as bad as I thought it would.<BR>
<BR>
After about thirty minutes a slight nausea was felt, nothing strong (I should mention at this point that I hadn't eaten a huge amount all day so that may have reduced the nausea somewhat).<BR>
<BR>
An hour and a half since I'd drank the mixture whilst taking a crap I started to feel the usual 'shit I'm coming up' kind of feeling, I reached for the mirror and 'low and behold' my eyes were slightly dilated. The next few minutes were full of the usual 'wow it's worked' and 'so im still alive, wait a sec lets check my pulse' kind of feelings. The tingling feeling of anxiety and excitement, the random giggling which could be either the drug kicking in or the feeling of self satisfaction that its actually begining to work and so on.<BR>
<BR>
I immediately went into my room and turned on some music, pretty good, not so much a connection to or enhancement of the music, but the music definately sounded louder, and when I closed my eyes I was lost in a sea of thoughts, occassionally coming back to reality and the music. For some reason I decided to wander downstairs and eat something, I grabbed a slice of water melon and went outside on the patio, (I dont know how long I'de been upstairs but the sun was starting to set so it must have be a while). The stains and marks on the red and yellow floor tiles started to become more vivid and 'alive', I started to 'see' witches on broomsticks, insects and other things (let me mention that I was NOT 'hallucinating' in my opinion, my mind was just off on some wierd imaginary journey, and I think the dilation of my pupils might have had something to do with it). I layed back and stared at the sky for a while (always a good thing on psychedelics), the colour of the sky was a more vivid vibrant blue, and the clouds were bright and white and fluffy, no wonderful colourful geometric patterns though, as with LSAs big cousin LSD. After a while of this I decided to watch the sunset, the colours were beautiful, and as I looked at the sun I could almost feel the light go into me/through me, I stood there for a while and took it all in.<BR>
<BR>
The mental and physical stimulation was something like that of other stimulants/hallucinogens but not as intense or as mind alterering. The feelings of exileration to the point of dizzyness were pretty cool. The euphoria was less than MDMA but more than marijuana, there was a definate mood-lift, nothing too extreme but it was there.<BR>
<BR>
A while later I decided to see if taste was enhanced, so a trip to the fridge was in order. I drank two particularly huge glasses of orange juice (I was drinking ALOT of liquid since I came up, I was also pissing constantly too), I ate a few little things too, but everything tasted 'artificial' somehow, pretty disgusting now I remember it, I also ate some chillies and couldnt feel much of a burn...so tastes (as with alot of other chemicals) was most definately not improved.<BR>
<BR>
About 30 mins after this I played on some video games, they seemed boring, and my attention span wondered constantly and I couldnt get into the game at all, I couldnt even see the TV properly becuase my eyes were so fucked (dilated, stuff seemed too bright etc).<BR>
<BR>
After a good three or so hours I started to come down, I felt tired, clumsy, and my mind was a little 'numb' , kind of like the day after a good dose of MDMA, but this in itself wasn't particularly unenjoyable, and all part of the psychedelic experience, after all if I didnt want to 'come down' I wouldnt have 'gone up' in the first place.<BR>
<BR>
Ive tried HBWR seeds several more times since then, I never felt as good as I did the first time and the feelings weren't as intense either. Once with nine seeds I felt almost 'drunk' and euphoric, with a kind of brain dead feeling all the way through about 6 hours, this wasn't exactly 'bad' though. Another time I tried nine seeds, I was really really fucked, ill, tired, couldnt sleep etc, which just shows the unpredictability of these seeds...proceed with caution.<BR>
<BR>
My conclusion with HBWR is that you can never be to sure (as with all natural psychoactives) of the amount of active compounds in the plant, therefore it makes for an unpredictable experience at the best of times. But all in all ide say I learnt alot from these little plants, and its yet another chemical notch on the bedpost to be proud of. My advice to people would be; if you want to 'trip' do LSD or something, but if you want to have a good time and generally enhance the situation then these seeds are for you, not to intense, easily managable and legal (but for how long with this persecution of psychoactives with the so called 'War On Drugs'?).
