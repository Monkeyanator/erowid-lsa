i recently ordered a large shipment of hawaiian baby woodrose and decided to try some out.i scraped and munched 6 seeds.heres what happened.<BR>
<BR>

12:30 PM:nothing yet...i think ill watch acid warp<BR>
<BR>
3:00 AM:huh? i fell asleep!oh well,damn ive gotta pee...<BR>
<BR>
6:00 AM:this is when it happened.someone was telling me to wake up.so i did. well, it was the wall,of course.he is so funny when he talks (at this time it felt natural that a wall was talking to me) and suddenly,a big euphoria hit me like a wave of pleasure. this was heaven. i could'nt move and the walls were as if i was 3 inches tall. At that moment i knew everything. This was THE best stoned i have ever had in my entire life. so i decided to go for a walk. i found that resting on a bench or something of the sort can bring the euphoria back. some slight visuals...<BR>

10:00 AM-5:00 PM: i was tripping and stoned all day. i definitely recommend these hbw's as they are most pleasant (no nausea!)
