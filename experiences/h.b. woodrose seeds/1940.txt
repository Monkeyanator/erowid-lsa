My friend Russ and myself had been doing research into psychedelics as well as other drug types, trying to find out what we could get a hold of legally, as well as how to ingest them, etc..<BR>
<BR>
After getting barely any effects from a (botched) yage potion involving Syrian rue and canary grass, we were ready to try something that required little culinary skill, as well as a quicker ingestion. Drinking two big glasses of grass-juice was not fun, even on an adventurous level. So we both decided that HWBR seeds would be the best bet for a sure-fire psychedelic experience.<BR>
<BR>
Neither I nor Russ had used anything like LSD, or even MJ for that matter before using HBWR seeds. The closest we'd come had been a very nice absinthe experience (Pernod + 3 tspns Wormwood). So, needless to say, we were very naive when we decided that 10 seeds would be a nice dosage for each of us. (Like I said, we were very inexperienced, and were let down by other attempts using natural, legal substances.)<BR>
<BR>
We were expecting nausea, lethargy, and, hopefully, some blissful euphoria. <BR>
<BR>
We awoke at 8:00a on what would turn out to be a beautiful Spring day, and crushed our seeds up for ingestion (we'd scraped off the outer coating the day before). Eagerly, we gobbled up the seeds. Of course, they tasted horrid, and I could feel them getting stuck in my teeth. But, it had to be done! Once swallowed, Russ and I waited in my den for the feelings to begin.<BR>
<BR>
The only one else who would be in the house that day was my brother, Scott, who had no concept of what Russ and I were doing, and most likely would not approve. So, him being home, and us trying to keep him from becoming suspicious, made for a potential paranoia session. I wasn't afraid, but Russ hadn't visited my home before, and had just met Scott, so he had some paranoia going in. I should've known...<BR>
<BR>
Less than fifteen minutes after ingestion, both Russ and I were sitting/lying on the floor feeling very weak and disoriented. We were both prepared for that. I knew that we'd soon be puking, so I went and got a small trash bin to receive our liquid presents. We both began feeling cold in our extremities (a feeling that neither of us was fond of), and soon we were both ready to puke. I can't remember who went first, I think it was myself. But soon we were residents of Vomitville. <BR>
<BR>
After puking for a bit, I drank some water and tried to get comfortable on my double papasan. Pulling up a blanket, I sat and dove headfirst into my first psychedelic journey. I will try to describe what I felt.<BR>
<BR>
The first good feeling that I noticed was what I referred to as the 'hum'. Some sort of buzzing that felt like the alternating current of the time-space continuum (yeah, right). My body itself wasn't feeling very good. Extremities were cold and slightly numb, and if I moved, my stomach ached. I stayed still, closed my eyes, and let my mind wander. I noticed a tightness in my chest, breathing had changed. Involuntarily, my breathing was slow and shallow, similar to deep sleep. Voluntarily, I felt as if I could hold my breath forever, and that if I so wished, I could hold my breath until I died (silly, but that's how it felt). So I would try holding my breath for periods of time, and as I did, the visions and thoughts became more intense. The longer I refrained from inhaling, the brighter and more vivid the mindscape became, swirling with bright light and humming with a flow that followed the energy surrounding and penetrating everything. It was quite beautiful. I kept thinking 'this is what death is like'. And, something in the mindscape affirmed my thoughts, it said that, 'yes, this is the place your mind goes at death.' I kept smiling. I felt as if I had tapped into something that very few people would ever know of, until they themselves died. This made me very happy. It was bliss.<BR>
<BR>
Russ, on the other hand, was not having such a good time. All the while I was feeling the aforementioned, Russ would interrupt me once every five or so minutes to ask if I was 'O.K.'. He'd say, 'I don't know, you just looked strange. I'm just making sure you aren't dead or anything.' I tried to explain to him what I was feeling, it was difficult to describe, and I don't think he was experiencing the same things. I asked him how he felt, and he wasn't feeling to good. I finally got up from my comfort zone and sat with him to talk about it. He kept puking, and I was afraid he might dehydrate. So I kept the water nearby for him. <BR>
<BR>
Scott was awake, and four hours had passed. We couldn't believe how time had moved so strangely. Russ was worried that Scott would come to the den and find out something was up, so we made up a story that Russ had a stomach virus, and we'd stayed up most of the night (that's why we were so lethargic). Anyway, Scott came down to let our dogs in, and didn't say very much. He went back upstairs. Later, Scott was on the phone, and Russ became very worried that he was calling the paramedics. I tried to calm him down, but, shit. It was ridiculous. The paranoia had struck Russ hard. He got up, wandered around the pool table striking his had on it and saying 'Why? How could I be so stupid?' It was a bad situation. Russ was paranoid that we'd both been poisoned, and that Scott was suspicious, and that every little noise he heard was an ambulance coming to get us. I didn't know what to do. He almost had me worried about us. I just tried to logically explain what was going on, how he was getting worried over nothing, etc. Looking back, I should've had some music going, and kept the lights up in the den. It was like a dungeon to Russ.<BR>
<BR>
About 5-6 hours had passed. We were both sitting on the floor looking at the clock, trying to figure out what time it was. The hands were moving forwards, then backwards, hell. It was funny. Russ had calmed a bit, and we were talking about what was going on. We looked at each other and could see purple/orange splotches all over. I opened the door to the den, and sunlight poured in. We instantly felt better! I picked up my guitar and played a bit of 'Little Wing'. I imagined Jimi Hendrix feeling the same feelings that I had. <BR>
<BR>
Scott came down the stairs, and wished to use the computer. I knew it was time to go outside. I couldn't wait! The air, the light, the leaves, the sky, the clouds, the grass, the earth, the animals, everything took on a brilliance all its own. Russ and I laid in the back yard on our backs watching the sky. It was heavenly. Birds would fly by, and every little movement of their wings was noticeable. Russ and I discussed how we are all connected simply by being alive. The birds, the grass, the trees, everything.<BR>
<BR>
I felt alienated somewhat from my family. Who are they, anyway? They're simply people who I live with, and nothing more. Bloodlines are a coincidence! We are all individuals! Something like that. Materialism was thrown way out the door. It was great! I could've rolled around in dogshit, and I wouldn't have cared (though I tried not to). I really felt close to the earth and everything on it. It was wonderful.<BR>
<BR>
Finally, it was time to come in and 'wait' for the trip to end. About ten hours had passed, and Russ and I felt like shit. Unable to do anything complicated, and unwilling to do anything else. I took a shower and could feel every hair on my body. I thought about shaving my facial hair off completely. Nah. The lighting in the bathroom had a strange orange glow to it. It felt good to be clean. Around 10:30 Russ and I got hungry and ate a bit. It was like eating for the first time in days. I had folded some laundry, and it felt good to be doing something constructive.<BR>
<BR>
Time for bed. Russ slept in the den, I went to my bedroom. I had much trouble getting to sleep. I felt half in, half out of the dream state. Not necessarily the hypogogic state, btw. I thought I heard Russ puking again, and sensed him in the bathroom on the other side of the wall. It got really bad, coughing and dry heaving, then suddenly it was as if he was choking, and he ran out of the bathroom, down the hall and flung open my door and sort of lunged at my bed to get my attention, then ran back out into the hall and collapsed. I truly felt all of this happening, and was quite frightened. I sat up slightly and looked at the door. It was closed. I had imagined the whole thing. So vivid!<BR>
<BR>
The next morning I asked Russ how he'd slept, he said 'great.'<BR>
<BR>
We were both very productive during the next day, as well as the next week. It was like coming home from a long vacation, anxious to get back to work. What a trip! We joke about the whole thing now, and every now and then I get a whiff or taste of something that reminds me of the HBWR seeds. YUK!!! Used coffee filters do it nicely. Horrible!<BR>
<BR>
To anyone who is in the situation Russ and I were in, that of wanting to experiment, but not knowing where to start, I do NOT recommend HBWR seeds. Try MJ first, if you can, and then maybe MDMA, if you can, AND THEN move on to something LSD related, if not LSD itself. DO NOT START WITH HBWR SEEDS. And, don't start anyway if you are a paranoid goofball like Russ!
