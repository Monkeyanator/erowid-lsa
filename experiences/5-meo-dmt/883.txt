Get Beautiful<BR>
<BR>
Closer, <BR>
Minds open easy-<BR>
get beautiful, <BR>
more useful, if flowers grow<BR>
in the unconsious.<BR>
Serenity siezes you quickly<BR>
impaling your evils, <BR>
holding them to a clearer light<BR>
which causes hate to dissipate. <BR>
<BR>
It's time to reconsider, <BR>
time to renegotiate-<BR>
reality,<BR>
as a whole<BR>
And then with eyes fully open<BR>
maybe the mind dances naturally. <BR>
Like colors that breath, <BR>
the same as i do <BR>
when ever sleep brings struggle, <BR>
and then sanity.<BR>
<BR>
Believe- <BR>
you are divine, <BR>
concieve now<BR>
all anger benign. <BR>
Within the world where peace pulses <BR>
through my body. <BR>
<BR>
Endlessly, <BR>
or ten minutes that comes in the pretence of forever. <BR>
Without malignance,<BR>
with holding reason-<BR>
and still nothing at all. <BR>
<BR>
With passion that makes you alive <BR>
and god inside of you, <BR>
glorifying your mind <BR>
and limbs<BR>
and nerves. <BR>
through spasms of shiva<BR>
flowing always in you. <BR>
Realize your breath-<BR>
get beautiful.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
yeah, i think i liked it.
