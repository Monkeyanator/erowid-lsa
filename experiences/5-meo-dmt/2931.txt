Got my hands on some 5MeO-DMT last year, sounded way, way crazy.  After some initial exploration I decided to get a 100 doses or so, from what I had been reading about it, it sounded like one time of doing it would be by far enough. Needless to say after the first 100, like 300 more were to follow. <BR>

There are three types of people that take 5meo, the majority of people like 95% of them have the wierdest most intense trip they have ever had.  You go from +0 (Base line)  To +5(Tripping out of your mind) in less then a second. There is no coming up, you are just there, and while you are there you are in a complete realm of tripping.  It seems if you have a spitual bent on the whole thing that you will have that sort of a result, otherwise it's just plain crazy.  About 4% of people will FREAK OUT: by this I mean they will just up and start walking around, screaming, going crazy, whatever, they will freak out, and really no babysitter is enough.  Luckily it only last about 5 minutes, so all is good.<BR>

Anyhow that last 1% of people it seems like 5meoDMT barely works for them, most of them seem to be heavy adicts of either meth of crack, although I don't know that that has anything to do with it, it is good to note.  In the end I decided a good drug for exploration not for distribution.  Try it or you and your psyconaut friends, not the whole darn town. Remeber that 4% that freak out.  Needless to say none of the experienced psychonauts seemed to be too badly damaged. Experienced in my case is; LSD,Mushrooms, 5meo-amt, 5meo-dipt, 5meo-dmt, dipt, amt, harmine, dmt, 2ct2, 2ct7, BZP, MDMA, DOB, MDA, DOM(STP), and that's just what I wrote before I got bored.
