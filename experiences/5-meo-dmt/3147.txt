Well, let me start off by saying that I would consider myself to be a very experienced drug user, but nothing could have prepared me for the effects of 5-meo-dmt.  I thought myself to be jaded to the effects of drugs, but this stuff knocked me on my ass!!!<BR>
<BR>
My friend had just purchased a large quantity of 5-meo-dmt.  I walked into his house with my boyfriend and my friend had already experienced the drug (by himself I might add...the crazy bastard!).  I was very excitied to try this drug, after hearing about his experience. <BR>
<BR>
I laid down on his bed and he held a small glass pipe to my mouth, with a flame underneath the bowl.  I inhaled the substance and then began to cough profusely.  My boyfriend was on the other side of the room, laying on a couch, and he  also took a hit of it and laid back.  I laid there and everything began to look fuzzy.  I was waiting for the full effects to begin.<BR>
<BR>
I sat up and commented on how everything looked weird and fuzzy.  My boyfriend was experiencing the same thing.  My friend said, 'you guys don't feel it yet?!?'  I told him I was waiting for it to come on and he said I should feel it immediately.<BR>
<BR>
I took another hit and again began to cough profusely.  I definitely felt the effects this time.  I went to grab a bottle of coke to get the soreness out of my throat, and it was very difficult to drink.<BR>
<BR>
I laid back and felt like I had just done 50 whippets.  The room was going wild and I could not focus or concentrate on anything.  Breathing became very difficult because of the harshness of the smoke.  I had no real concept of what was going on.  I could not fathom reality, time, where I was, or what the hell was going on.  I described this feeling to a friend as being in a k hole, on numerous hits of acid, while doing whippets.<BR>
<BR>
I became extremely paranoid as breathing seemed to become increasingly difficult.  I began to try to take deep breaths, but I didn't know if the air was coming in or going on.  I really thought that I was going to die.  I had a little voice in the back of my head telling me this was it and that I was going to die.  I pulled all my strength together and yelled 'HELP!'  It felt like I was having a nightmare and trying to scream.<BR>
<BR>
I realized I was screaming 'HELP! HELP!' and all I wanted to do was go to the hospital.  I was thinking about my life and the consequences of going to the hospital, but all of that seemed unimportant because I thought I was really dying.  I could not see straight at all and I didn't know what was going on around me.  I began to try to rip my hair out.  I was terrified out of my mind.  I had no idea that my boyfriend (also on 5-meo-dmt) had snapped out of his trip and was on top of me, trying to restrain me.  I remember pulling on my hair and my forehead feeling sweaty.  I don't really know anything else that was going on around me. <BR>
<BR>
The next thing I knew, I was in the fetal position and  I opened my eyes to see my friend standing in the room and my boyfriend sitting on the couch.  Everything looked very cloudy and I was seeing crazy trails off of everything.  I still could not see straight, but at this point, I had a grip on what was going on.  My friend ask if I was ok and I said that I wasn't sure.<BR>
<BR>
I slowly got up and asked my boyfriend to come and sit with me.  I was holding onto him and my friend left the room.  I began to touch my boyfriend and I felt highly sensual (not sexual).  I wanted to touch him all over, but he was still feeling somewhat of the after effects himself, although he had experienced nothing close to what I had.<BR>
<BR>
After everything looked more and more normal, I began asking what had happened, where everyone was while I was freaking out, and what I was doing.  I felt a sense of relief and all the tension and anxiety I had felt seemed to melt away.<BR>
<BR>
I watched another person try 5-meo-dmt that night and he just laid there, breathing heavily, with a big smile on his face.  I don't know why I reacted the way I did and nobody else had.  <BR>
<BR>
I have never flipped out on drugs before or felt a drug take over me the way 5-meo-dmt had.  I continue to ponder the effect it had on me and I think I may try it again, in a safe, controlled enviroment, but not anytime soon.
