Yesterday I has a San Pedro cactus experience, and I'd just like to type up a quick post for those of you who are wondering about trying San Pedro. A friend of mine ordered 50 dried grams of San Pedro cactus from an online supplier. He boiled it in 6 cups of water for about 3 hours, and when the liquid was brown, murky and extremely bitter-soap tasting, he stopped. He strained out the cactus solids, and divided the remaining liquid into two glasses, and cooled it in the frige untill it was drinkable.<BR>
<BR>
Due to the extreme bitter taste, he added orange juice to each large glass, but it did little to cover the taste. I am not exagerating when I say it tasted as if i was drinking pure liquid dish-soap. <BR>
<BR>
We both drank it slowly over about 30 mins, and when i was finished drinking that foul, basic liquid..it felt almost identical as if i had consumed 2 alcoholic drinks. This light intoxication lasted approx. 2 hours, when we both began to feel the mescalines effects come on. <BR>
<BR>
*There was no sickness or vomiting*<BR>
<BR>
For the next 10 hours, we had a rather weak, but pleasant mescaline trip. It felt like a very long time to come on, compared with LSD or psilocybin, but it was soon unmistakibly mescaline. The intensity of the experience was weak, roughly comparable to ~40ug of LSD.<BR>
<BR>
It faded away about 9 hours after the efects were first felt, it completely faded to baseline. <BR>

If i were to to it again, and prepare the cactus myself...I would boil it for at least 6 hours, and i would would drink the solution from all 50 dried grams of cactus...i would not share it with a friend. It's intresting to try once, but not really worth the time, effort and expense compared to more potent and available psychedelics, IMHO.
