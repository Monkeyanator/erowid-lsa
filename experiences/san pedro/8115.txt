SET AND SETTING<BR>
<BR>
After living in the city for the past year I needed a reconnection with the earth force so I decided to celebrate the summer soltice by trying san pedro for the first time. I had a great experience and might say this is my new favorite plant friend.<BR>
  <BR>
Most of my trips I have done as part of a personal retreat, usually in the wilderness and usually alone.  In my experience, this kind of ritualistic care given to set and setting always provides a deeper and more meaningful experience than doing these substances casually.  This is what works for me anyway.<BR>
<BR>
So for this experiment, I hiked to one of my favorite spots in Big sur, a grouping of sandstone caves and twisted rock formations that, as it turned out, became a spectactular place to trip.<BR>
<BR>
((Advice) If you take a psychedelic alone, know what you are doing and make sure you are in a safe place when you do it.  The fear factor can easily get out of hand on high doses if you believe you are in a dangerous place.)  <BR>

PREPARTAION<BR>
<BR>
I used a live cutting of the san pedro catus, purchased from a specialty plant dealer in California.  The cutting was about 13 inches long and was prepared by first removing the spines, (a lot of work that next time I will skip) then making vertical cuts along the plant and peeling off the top few mm of skin.  The remaining inner core was cut into slices that looked like stars.  I heard that most of the mescaline in in the outer skin but I used the core pulp as well to get any that may have been there.  Next step was to dry the gelatinous pieces in a oven on low heat for an hour or so.<BR>
<BR>
After drying, I bagged and stored it all in the freezer for 2 weeks until the trip.  The night before the trip, I boiled the dry cactus pieces in 3 washes for 45 min each wash.  An aluminum pot was used which I have heard interferes with the alkaloids, but nevertheless, I was able to get an effective dose. I then combined the 3 washes and boiled till I had 100ml of thin liquid.  It wasn't slimy and pretty easy to get down, tasting like salty tequila (which is also mad from a cactus).  I've heard nothing but bad reports from thoes who have made a milkshake out of the plant.  This way worked great.<BR>
<BR>

THE TRIP<BR>
<BR>
After offering a prayer to the mountains at dawn, I drank the liquid in a couple gulps and sat in one of the caves.<BR>
<BR>
45min:  I felt very at peace and could see the details of far away peaks.  Overall there was the sense of purity that I have come to equate with the approach of a plant deity.<BR>
<BR>
1.5 hr:  I began thinking that the dose was too weak this was as far as it would take me so I took a few hits of cannabis from a pipe.  WOW!!  Within 3 minutes there was a major change in my state.  I had the feeling of being in the presence of a powerful, all pervasive force and that this force was the earth.  Then, remembering a part of a Castaneda book where Don Juan warns Castaneda to treat the magic plants with respect or they could easily kill him by making a rock fall or using the wind to make him slip off a cliff, I became somewhat alarmed and fearful of the earth's power and my utter helplessness.  The fear that these things could easily happen to me became too real.  I knew though, that I need not have fear if my concscience was clean and gave my trust to the mountains.<BR>
<BR>
I always find the initial comming on of a psychedelic to be the most difficult part.  It is a period of confession where my actions and their results are reflected to me and stand along side the purity of the plant entity.  I felt quilty about nothing though, other than having recently gotten into the habit of littering too often and I resolved to not do that any more.  <BR>
<BR>
I then crawled into one of the smaller caves and sat back.  The opening of the cave looked like a womb and I settled into the trip feeling safe again.<BR>
<BR>
The next few hours very of profound interest with meaningful visual distortions.  I looked out at the rock face across from me, seeing all sorts of shapes, including both a san pedro stalk and a peyote button in the rocks! The source of the Mayan and Aztec stone carvings I've seen had to be from psychedelic induced vision I decided then because I was seeing such similar faces and shapes there in the stone.  I decided to make a story out of the objects I was seeing.  The only connection between the objects that made logical sense at the time was a story about the history of the universe that said: <BR>
<BR>
Long long ago,<BR>
God was one being<BR>
but divided itself into separate beings<BR>
in order to experince life in the flesh.<BR>
The world of 3-dimensional illusions came into being<BR>
with all the parts of God<BR>
taking the forms of the animals <BR>
and the people and they lived on the back of a great turtle.<BR>
These where our ancestors<BR>
and when they died they<BR>
their souls rose and swam through the ocean in the <BR>
bodies of dolphins for thousands of years<BR>
before walking on to land and <BR>
becoming human beings.<BR>
The great goal of this cosmic<BR>
drama was for the individule<BR>
soul to realize that it is <BR>
part of the one being<BR>
on a journey through countless forms.<BR>
<BR>
I was most impressed by the scale of time on which the story was put. The history of humans on the earth has been a recent and brief pursuit of God/Us and that the cosmos will go on and on long after humans and even the earth dissapear.  At that moment I think I understood what eternity meant. The colors of the rocks were intensified too during the trip and very beautiful as was the music of a VAS album I listened to. (an amazing dead-can-dance like band to check out)<BR>
<BR>
Because mescaline is an amphetamine, I was pleasently un-troubled by drowsiness like in a mushroom trip. By sunset the effects had subsided completely and I slept where I was that night.  I estimated the trip to be 10 hours.<BR>
<BR>
The next day I hiked to my car and drove home, making a stop to buy a razor.  I went to a Rite-Aid drug store (a thing I rearely do) and was blown away by how ugly and offensive the displays were with the blaring colors and screaming slogans.  I bought the razor and left as quick as I could.<BR>
<BR>
I came back from this trip feeling like I had been let in on a secret and that because I knew it, Life was on my side and that, whatever insane ventures man comes up with, there will be the eternal law of 'doing good=good returned to you' to take care of me. <BR>
<BR>
Suggestions for next time:<BR>
1. use a glass pot to cook the cactus<BR>
2. take 15 inches<BR>
3. be patient with the onset
