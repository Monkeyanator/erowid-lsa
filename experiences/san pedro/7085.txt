I was recently browsing the web, and after looking at a few articles on mescaline peyote and san pedro, I though I would give it a try. Fresh San Pedro Cactus just happened to be for sale on EBAY, so I bought it (paid $30 for a 3 foot section). After reading all the information on preparation, I wasnt exactly sure how I wanted to prepare it. I wanted something that would be really quick and easy, so, I took the spines off the cactus, removed the outter dark green area (about 1/4' thick), and boiled the darker green skinned sections in a liter of water for about an hour. After straining, I put all the material in a plastic  bag and put it in the freezer. The liquid was a light green color, and tasted fucking horrible at best. As a matter of fact, it took about 2 hours just to get the nerve to swallow the crap. Well, I did. <BR>

I felt slight nausea immediately after consuming it, however it went away after 15 mins or so. It was about 1 hour and 15 minutes later when I started to notice its effect. I felt like I was drunk only with a clear head. Colors were more vivid, and I had a sense of inner warmth. The expirience reminded me of something between shrooming and acid. Only  my mind stayed clear. I really enjoyed the expierience, and will try to consume more of the disgusting green liquid again.
