dmt --- isn't that an interesting memory!?<BR>
<BR>
i had the good fortune of being turned on by someone that i trust. it tasted like i was smoking plastic -- very strange. very quickly the trees outside began moving around wildly, as if i could suddenly see some type of animism things kinda melted -- i wasn't driving, had little control as soon as i started to worry, it started to fade away, then was gone (time for more)<BR>
<BR>
there was something dark about it that bothered me a great deal, mostly in a vague, can't put my finger on it way i know this sounds funny, but it felt like i was tapping into the dark side of the force (metaphor, not literal)<BR>
<BR>
all in all a very interesting experience<BR>

not for the faint at heart or those who fear being out of direct control
