This was my first trip, and I wanted it to be the hardcore euphoric experience that the hippies had. I did not realize that potency had decreased since then. I took 6 blotter tabs at first to have a HARD trip, as my veteran friend took 5 and I wanted to out do him.<BR>
<BR>
The setting is 4:20PM, Arizona desert on 4/20/01. The symbolism had something to do with it, but it was also just spontaneous that we came across this product.<BR>
<BR>
4:45PM (same day): I am seeing and feeling the notes of Purple haze rolling like steam off of the car. I could taste the sand that was falling through my hands, much as Plato and Scorates did many years previous.<BR>
<BR>
I took 6 more hits of the same, time is 9:00PM I am still WAY up on my first trip, but I wanted to see how fucked I could get.<BR>
<BR>
And on the way home, the love of my life called me on my Cell phone, and I wrote this about our conversation, as soon as I returned home:<BR>
<BR>
Night Sky:<BR>
<BR>
You called tonight on your way home, <BR>
to ask me to go outside and share <BR>
the moon---his orb eerily red, <BR>
seducing you with glimpses, <BR>
between dark rain-filled clouds. <BR>
<BR>
Our life together has been driven <BR>
by the endless phases of the moon, <BR>
his ebb and flow silently pulling <BR>
us from night sky to night sky, <BR>
moments disappearing and reappearing <BR>
in his misty tide of stars; <BR>
glistening spots of light, <BR>
cool against a black marble sky. <BR>
<BR>
We have a brotherhood, <BR>
this moon and I, <BR>
an understanding of sorrow so cold, <BR>
and dark that time does not loosen <BR>
the grip of pungent memory. <BR>
<BR>
I first tasted your love in his presence, <BR>
when his star children whispered the secret, <BR>
that we were already caught in the current, <BR>
destined to ride his seasons, <BR>
until he calls us no more.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I went home and didn't sleep for 3 days. I noticed that Sex with my girlfriend has a much different feel to it, when on all of the substances that I was. It was almost if it had taken a gigantic step up.<BR>
<BR>
I loved the Ethereal feeling I received from this experience.<BR>
<BR>
I do, however, reccomend that you not take as big of a dose as I did, even if you are a pro. I came down VERY hard and had suicidal tendancies, because I was losing my high, and I wanted it to go on forever. This caused great sadness. But I quickly ran and got more LSD 1 week later.<BR>
<BR>
I trip on average 2-3 times a week, and I love it. Though, I have yet to achieve the effects I received with the first trip.
