my friend G and i each took a hit of acid at my girlfriend's house and then after about 3 hours we left and drove 50 minutes back to my house...nothing.  we felt nothing.  5 hours later.  nothing.  duds, we were mad.<BR>
<BR>
so G left and went home and at about midnight, my world exploded like an atom bomb.  i have tripped once before this, and i didn't understand what was happening, but i knew it was so good, it was SOOO good...  <BR>
<BR>
:::conscience:::<BR>
<BR>
i just grooved with it.  my head opened up and i thought every thought and dreamed every dream that anyone had ever (and will ever) think or dream.  my entire being overflowed with life and thought and dreams and hope and...<BR>
<BR>
:::awareness:::<BR>
<BR>
i laid down on my floor and put on my studio headphones (AMAZING sound quality) and turned on some Hallucinogen (for anyone reading this, Hallucinogen is a british psytrance artist.  his album 'twisted' changed my world, and i recommend you buy it N OW).  so i just succumbed to these booming trance beats and guttural grinding noises and i let myself float to the outer reaches of my own mind.  i traveled untrodden trails of my own brain and discovered avenues of life in my head that i never knew were there.<BR>
<BR>
:::pulsating:::<BR>
<BR>
then i took these gloves i have for raving that have glowing LED lights for fingertips and i went into my bathroom with a discman playing 'trance stimuli' and i just left my body.  i went through the entire album dancing in my bathroom thinking these explosive thoughts and discovering new life in an album i heard so many times.  and my gloves...my gloves blew my mind.  when the last track finished i was dripping with sweat down my entire body, but i wasn't tired.<BR>
<BR>
3:15am<BR>
<BR>
:::serene:::<BR>
<BR>
i laid on my front lawn and smoked cigarettes and just re-examined my ENTIRE being.  i thought about every aspect of my existence inside and out and i came to a conclusion after 2 hours of constant thought.<BR>
<BR>
everything is all right....<BR>
<BR>
:::peacefulness:::<BR>
<BR>
i eventually slept and called G immediately when i woke up to tell him what i had experienced.  'say no more my friend,' he replied, 'i was right there with you.'<BR>
<BR>
and he was.... we never told each other about our trips because i knew and he knew there was no need.  we had a telepathic connection i never thought possible...he KNEW, and i KNEW.<BR>
<BR>
:::inexplicable:::<BR>
<BR>
but WONDERFUL.
