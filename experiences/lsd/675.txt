I was 18 the first time I experienced what would forever change my life.  My friend had done acid before, and I was intrigued with how a small piece of paper could cause some of the things she described.  She led me on my first trip...<BR>

We were walking from a neighbor's apartment to our apartment, which was only a few yards when the effects started to occur.  It seemed like it took days to walk the short distance.  The hairs on my arms began to stand up...the air felt light...I felt like I was gliding along...noticing things I had never noticed before.  Lights had multiple colors, not just the white color I had only seen before.  The wind made the most incredible, exciting sounds through the trees.  Words are insufficient to describe the experience.  I felt I was in touch with the universe...like I was one with my friend...we could read each other's thoughts.  Life made absolute sense.<BR>

I have described it to people by saying that the 'walls in my mind were torn down.'  I have never since seen life the same as before the first experience.  There is more reality now, be it good or bad, REALITY.  It is this continued perception that makes me believe one never comes down after doing acid.
