It was a friday night and after my friend and I had gotten back home, we decided to trip.  Well, actually we had decided to two days ago, but that was just the point-of-no-return per se.  Anyway, I had 3 hits in my posession.  1 white blotter with a star on it, and two sweet tarts that had had liquid lsd dripped onto them.  Around 12 I took the white blotter and my friend took one sweet tart.  We waited, and waited, and waited for what seemed like forever.  <BR>

My friend mentioned that he was hungry and so we decided to get some midnight snacks.  We went into my kitchen and made some popcorn and sandwiches.  For some odd reason i started staring at the popcorn and when i realized that i had been staring at the popcorn for some time, i realized that my friend was not in the kitchen anymore.  So, out of fear that my parents or younger sibling would discover him tripping balls, I started whispering out his name, and after what seemed like an eternity of searching i found him standing in front of a mirror in my entry-hall and all he said was look at the mirror.  Now this is probably my only regret of the night, however, I have grown from this mistake and I am sure that it is only specific to me, but I decided to look in the mirror.  It was AMAZING, my face suddenly became nothing and then was immediately an 'aliens' head (those grey ones that are commonly depicted on TV).  This scared the crap out of me.  So my friend and I decided it would be best to go back into my room.  <BR>

I felt extrememly uneasy and anxious almost paranoid.  I decided to get on IRC and talk to some 'experts' I knew.  As indicated by a so-called 'expert' i started watching Tom and Jerry.  My friend started laughing his balls off, while I could only think of how bad it must be to be the little mouse helpless to such a predator as a large cat.  However, again this i believe is only specific to me and furthermore sprouted from an incident that occurred only a month before.  Anyway i felt that what i needed to do was just lay down and relax and listen to some music.  So I got in my bed and realized that it would all be over soon and that i should just enjoy it while i could. So I just relaxed and listened to some Bob Marley and closed my eyes and looked at all the patterns and amazing visuals that I was seeing.  There were so many that I cannot remember them all, however, there are two that stuck out in my mind.  One occurred after my friend had insisted on turning out the lights and turning off the TV.  I was staring at my wall and noticed how it looked almost like liquid, so I decided to touch it and when I did, it rippled and some of the 'liquid' came off on my hand and quickly started engulfing my entire hand, I loved this, it was right out of the matrix.  Another wonderful visual that I experienced was when I suddenly felt this urge to stare at my fingers.  My index and middle finger suddenly turned into cartoon baby blue-jay's. <BR>

Contradictions and Additional Notes:  I forgot to mention that around 12:45 after feeling no significant effect, i took the third sweet-tart.  And also, my 'friend' who I was with insisted on turning out the lights and TV, which pissed me off, but because of the fear of inducing a 'bad trip' i didn't argue.
