I started doing lsd at the age of 13. I am now 15. I know in your article it said you were also 15. I know what your talking about I havent done lsd in over half a year. I too wake up morning after morning with tracers..confusion..slight visuals..And not to mention slight problems with everyday activity. my freinds see me different.<BR>

i see me different. And thats the worst part. My freinds make me feel stupid alot. They constantly poke fun at my stupidity. And take advantage of my gulability. I sometimes stare off into nothing. But it has its good points. I see things in a different way. I watch my self not to poke fun at others. I feel im a better person. And i realise my flaws more. When i see people now. That i have made fun of before. I think about how mean i was to them. I have apologised for alot of things ive done wrong. But i think lsd has caused me to learn a think or two..and maybe even a few morals. <BR>

I wrote this to tell you not to worry. Youll be ok. Its all a mindframe. Or something like that. Im not to good on termanology. But i also have freinds that have the same problem. Some worse then mine. But im not that bad off. Its only a slight difference. But i have a different mind set. To anyone reading this. I wouldnt recomend doing lsd if you havent already.
