 I was 17 at the time and I remember getting back from school and calling up one of my boys and asking what was up for the night.  It was a friday. He told me that he could hook up some acid, so I said let's try it. So me and my twin brother went to his canton 20 minutes later and he already hooked up 10 tabs for 25 bones, so we gave him our share and we all took 3 tabs each. He saved 1 for the next day.<BR>

I drank a big cup of orange juice to help kick in the effects (I don't know if that really works) and waited. Twenty-five minutes went by and I didn't feel a thing. I thought we got ripped off and my homie says, 'He said this shit was potent.' And I said, 'Man, we took 3 doses and I ain't feeling shit.' Five minutes went by and I realized how wrong I was. This shit had me on a 14 hour trip. In the peak I saw everything in a glittery glow and everything I looked at began to melt. My bro and T said they felt it too. They said they saw tracers and my brother said that he felt like he was melting. It was insane.<BR>

Anyway, I was listening to my walkman and I go outside of my homie's pad. It was already getting dark, but then I started to notice that everything began to move with the rhythm of the music (I was listening to some Jimi Hendrix). It was so intense how the timing was just exact, it would slow down then pick up pace. The sounds I heard in the music resembled life, it was like reality was represented by the music and I could feel myself floating. I let my eyes go out of focus and then I saw hundreds of little pictures of me right in front of my eyes, like I was staring at myself from behind while I was looking into a mirror. I looked to the sky and I saw the stars forming geometric shapes. I have never had an LSD trip like this before, this was something else.<BR>

I saw a cat calling for me and I looked into its eyes and realized that I began to communicate with it. I really understood what it wanted. I think it was a stray cat and it seemed to be lonely. I could see what it was thinking, and it undersood how I felt. Let me tell you, I'm not a cat person, but I started to pet it and it felt grateful for my company. All of a sudden it sounded like it was whispering words to me. Though I couldn't understand what it was saying, I felt it was speaking truths. My bro and T were just sittin' there on the couch just tripping, laughing at everything, man. But I saw this and it seemed as though I knew why it was like this and I couldn't explain it. I could still hear the cat then I said, 'Farewell, little guy and good luck.' I went back into the room and tried to tell these guys what was happening, but they were laughing too much, so I couldn't blame them.<BR>

I sat on the couch and listened to my walkman. I felt like I was in the music. I couldn't see myself anymore, I could just hear the music all around me. Then I closed my eyes and opened them to what seemed to be a universe and all this time I could hear music playing in the backround. I lost track of time and it seemed like an eternity, but when I closed my eyes and opened them again, I was in my neighborhood walking and it was daytime. This all on the kraziest 14 hour acid trip of my life. I tell you, this really was something else. Almost like a dream in reality.
