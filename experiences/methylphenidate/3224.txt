It all started off as a rumour that you could get a buzz snorting ritalin. All school year, I tried to get some, but I wasnt trying hard. Finally, on the second to last day of school, someone asked me to borrow 50 cents, he said he would give me all of his prescription ritalin. SO, I agreed.<BR>
<BR>
The next day, The person told me that he needed his parents signature to get his medication. I thought 'Oh, Im screwed,' but, no, I forged a fake letter and forged a signature. At the end of the day, I got the ritalin, and brought them home.<BR>

<BR>
I have did Ritalin more times than this, but I have quit now because I cant get it anymore and I have had enough of being a rambling idiot like Ritalin makes you.<BR>
<BR>
Conclusion:<BR>
During the 3 month break between doing Ritalin, I fiended for it real bad. Although I had fun I found it addicting.
