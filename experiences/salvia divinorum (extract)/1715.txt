I just recently purchased 1/4 onze dried Salvia leaves and a small bottle of Salvia extract ........I had read that smoking the leaves alone does not produce much effect so I took the leaves, laid them on a plate and then sprinkled the whole bottle of extract over them.  I let the liquid evaporate.  Then I packed a small pipe full and torched it with a butane lighter as I inhaled.  I held the smoke in for a good amount of time.....it took about 3 intakes for me to finish this small bowl.  <BR>

I felt a weird buzzing pressure which felt like it was originating behind the upper part of my nose and pulsating throughout my skull and slightly through my body.  I also felt a slight body numbness....I decided to pack another bowl and proceeded to smoke that one, I took one hit and felt the strongest buzzing/dizzy feeling I have ever experienced.  I tried laying back and closing my eyes, but I did not trip. It was defintely a foreign feeling .....At its peak (which was the first and last hit out of the second bowl) I can best describe the feeling as--> I felt as if I was about to lose consciousness.<BR>

Basically, for the $45 I spent I recieved an intense buzz.  I'm still curious and will try again.
