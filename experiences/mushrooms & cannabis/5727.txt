<!--stupid smoked mushroom report, but reports effects 3 hrs later--><BR>
<BR>
I am 18, and my parents went out for the day to a business presentation.  I had the house all to my self for 15+ hours with no narcotics.  This wouldn't be so bad, but I was jonesing like a madman.  Anyways, I remembered that when my friend was over, he spilled his weed on the carpet.  I was desperate (sad isn't it?) to get high today.  I managed to find about 3 or so hits of premium bud.  Though I figured that this wasnt enough.  I then recalled reading that you can smoke shrooms to produce a buzz.  Well, I had just cleaned out a 1/4 oz. bag a few nights prior and thought that there might be some powder left.  <BR>
<BR>
Well to my surprise, there was.  Not enough to eat, but enough to top off my bowl.  I had a cigarette, the lit up.  The taste from the burning shrooms was very.. um, different.  Instantly, I got this wierd body sensation that I had never felt before.  As soon as the top layer of shroom dust was gone, the familiar taste of sweet green took over.  When the bowl was dry, I was a little dissapointed because I felt very little.  <BR>
<BR>
5 minutes later though, this wierd, intense rush engulfed my entire body.  I could feel the pot working, but what I felt was a totaly new experience.  I was having a cigarette at the time, looked over at a poster I have on the wall of my bedroom, and it started to bend in every direction.  I felt so fucked, yet calm at the same time.  I looked at the snow out of my window, and noticed small blips racing around in circles, with very multicolored tails.  It was incredible.  Such a small amount of shrooms, fucked me up good.  Just a note, these shrooms were the best I have ever had in my whole drug 'career'.  I read that the effects lasted only about 25 minutes or so, but to my surprise, I am still moderately fucked up in a new way, 3 hours later!  Fuckin' cool!  I definately will be setting aside a half gram or so, on my next 1/4 oz trip for smoking.  I loved it!  I highly reccomend that you try this when you happen to have an abundance of shrooms, or in my case, a mad jones with no drugs.  Oh well.  It was freakin awesome.  <BR>

On another note, Has anyone mixed shrooms, and LSD before?  I am thinking of trying this and would like any experiences emailed to me.  pulserate@hotmail.com .  This would be very appreciative.
