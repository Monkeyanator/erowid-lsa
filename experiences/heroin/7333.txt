I've used heroin about 25 times now over the course of 2 years and I'm not even close to being addicted. I suspect that people with a perpensity to become addicted to anything are the ones that become addicted quickly. Some people use addiction as a way of getting attention and herion is a lowly but shiek addiction as it is asscociated with the pacifistic strugglig artist. Herion addiction is high among homeless and very low income users as it seems they little else to occupy themselves with. Herion is abundant on the urban streets and costs about $6 dollars for a strong hit (usually sold with a small amount of cocaine to mix with, called 'a One-In-One'). The stuff is cheaper than alcohol for most indigent people and thus they use it constantly.<BR>

While the heroine trip is egocentric the user is somewhat empathetic. The trip is similar to a very lazy MDMA (E) experience but without much urge to interact with people. It is also similar to the experience one feels right after orgasm in sex - you just want to lie there and be really lazy and feel the bliss. Another drug that reminds me of herion is Diazepam (Valume). About 30mg of Valume (very easy to get online at any foreign pharmacy - you just have to ask them) is pretty close to a H buzz (although sex is better on Valume), in fact Valume is sort of a better trip as there is no queesyness, urge to vomit or constant itching as there is with H. These are definately some of the qualities that make Heroin very NON-addictive for me.<BR>

If your going to do the stuff start out by doing nasal drops, don't smoke it. Smoking Herion is a big waste - if you miss ANY smoke 'chasing the dragon', you've just about blown it and wasted your money. On top of that you'll get really queesy the first few times you smoke it -and I guarantee you throw up if you hold in a big hit.<BR>

Nasal drops are made by taking a small amount of black tar heroin (about the size of a BB), putting it in a vile or shot glass and adding appoximately 25 drops of water. Then you put the shot glass and contents in the microwave for 12-15 seconds (no longer as it will boil out!). If you don't have a microwave just add very hot water to the H-tar. The sloution should be light to medium transparent brown. If the solution is too dark - add more water (that means that the herion is really pure). The opaqueness of the solution is the indicator of the strength (never directly put really dark herion in your body -you could have some problems!)Always dilute it until you can at least see through it.<BR>
<BR>
Start out by putting (2) drops of the solution in a teaspoon. Angle the spoon up to one nostril and close your other nostril (like your doing a line), then snort the liquid. Keep snorting so it doesn't run back out of your nose (ha-ha). Believe it or not it's a lot easier on the nose snorting liquid than powder. Ater you done it wait 15 minutes and guage the feeling. If you can handle more then do another 2 drops then wait another 30 minutes. Keep doing this at 30 minute intervals until you're comfortably high. Don't do too much!! Don't do more than twenty drops! With H, less is more.. find a medium ground and don't do any more. You'll be thankfull later as your current trip intensifies because the drops take a while to get into your blood stream.<BR>

The nasal drops are the safest way to do this stuff if you're going to do it at all. Honestly, I don't think H is the best drug in the world although the 'warm and fuzzy' feeling you get is nice. At higher doses -you accomplish nothing but passing out.<BR>
<BR>
Honestly I could care less if I ever did the stuff again, although I've never tried China White or any powder and I'd probably try that once.<BR>
<BR>
Have fun, stay away from the needles and don't do too much!<BR>
