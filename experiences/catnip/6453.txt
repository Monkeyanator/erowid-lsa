I strongly suggest to anyone that is stressed to try catnip.  It is cheap, easy and HIGHLY RELAXING!  I feel comfortable in every position and could easily fall asleep right now.  I also feel as though I have nothing to worry about, all the problems of the day can wait till later.  It is nothing like being 'high' although I do enjoy the feeling very much.  I will try smoking a marijuana and catnip mixture in the future but for now I'm gonna take a nap.  Peace.
