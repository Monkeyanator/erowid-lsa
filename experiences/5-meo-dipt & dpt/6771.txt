I became interested in experimenting with this compound after reading Shulgin's book on tryptamines. Apparently, this molecule has quite extraordinary effects with respect to libidal/tactile enhancements, but I am more interested in its potential as an entheogen.<BR>

My first experience took place at Walden Pond; the  setting for Henry David Thoroeau's famous 'WALDEN' (suggested reading) in Concord, MA. Having read reports of a special synergy with Dipropyltryptamine, and reports of mostly tactile enhancements regarding this compound, I decided to mix the two off hand in my experiment (despite having only achieved threshold effects from DPT in my oral and insulfation experiments with DPT). I did not weigh scientifically accurate doses of either drug, (I'm a jazz drummer, I cannot afford that type of scale!) but I estimate (in my limited experience) the dosage at around 130mgs. DPT to 10mgs. 5MEODIPT) placed in a gelcap and swallowed on an empty stomach.<BR>

Well, the only effects I noticed this day were an increased sensitivity to psychic energies emitted from the beautiful people and wildlife present in this enviornment. I was also exceptionally effecient at certain occult practices such as energizing my chakras, meditating, and the like. Not bad, but no mindfuck as I was expecting......<BR>
<BR>
My next trial involved insulfating a rather large pile of the compound which I estimate to be around 70mgs.....  I was in a great mood, it was the morning, I went for a walk on a nearby beach. I had some extreme naseau coming up, but it was not sufficient to cause vomiting. I rapidly shot up in an LSD like manner, but the major effects of the LSD experience seemed to be absent. The psychological intensity was much less than that of LSD, but the sensory effects pertaining to hearing and bodily/kinesthetic integration were astounding.<BR>

I smoked some MJ with a fellow musician/soulbrother and we proceeded to play music involving he on his Hammond Organ and yours truly on drumset. Although he had not taken any psychedelic agent, it was apperant that my 'deepened state of awareness' had had some effect on his psyche, as has happened numerous times before when I take a psychedelic, and he takes nothing. We found ourselves amazed at the profunditiy and complexity of our musical relationship, and I found myself playing complex musical structures I thought only someone like Elvin Jones or Tony Williams could pull off. (Drummers reading this, take SERIOUS NOTE:)  Anyhow, it seems this drug is quite suited for those musicians who like to 'take it out, seriously' and I am sure many other diciplines would find practical applications for this compound, as it is short lived and manageble.
