I drank the putrid tea that I boiled for about ten minutes.  The stuff really is disgusting, making Yohimbe tea taste like Kool Aid.  <BR>

I did the stuff twice and both times the effects didnt hit me until the next day.  It certainly doesnt give you a trip, but what it does is make you feel refreshed, focused, and extroverted.  It never fails.  I don't believe this is a placebo reaction because I never expected this to be the outcome when I first took it.  I was expecting aphrodesiac qualities only.  Although I wouldnt classify this root as a sexual stimulant, I would say that it gives you more confidence and 'go get'em' attitude that certainly is condusive to that activity.<BR>

Anyways, boil, strain and add some sugar, honey or something to take the edge off the bitter taste and chug it down at night before bed and I guarrantee you'll have a great following day.  I get mine from an online herb company.  They send you a pulverized form of the root and boil a cup of that stuff in however much water you feel like drinking it in.
