I mixed like 1/3 of an ounce of mandrake root in a blender with about 1/2 of an ounce of galangal root and an equal amount in mass of damiana and scullcap. I blended it up and wound up with a large amount of the mix. I was waiting for the water to boil when I smoked a bowl of the mixture. It had some minor effects. Nothing exciting though. <BR>
<BR>
I returned and wrapped some of the mix in a coffee filter and put it in a tea ball. I had one teapot full of a light green-brownish liquid. I boiled the rest of the mix in a pot and ended up with a very dark liquid, I added lemon juice to a small amount and boiled some of the mix in another pan. I strained the liquid and had a good amount of some dark stuff. I mixed a large glass with half of the light tea and half of the dark tea. I had a few of these and began smoking a bowl of cannabis. I mixed some wormwood in because I previously had experienced a weird buzz from smoking it with cannabis. I have smoked it on its own before and gotten somewhat high off it. I read about its smokable psychoactivity in Pendell's Pharmo/kopeia. It is odd, and I have smoked fresher wormwood and the effect was stronger. <BR>
<BR>
I began to get stoned, I think I packed another bowl. I got more tea and when I ran out of the light stuff I still had lots of the dark stuff left. I drank that quickly in several large glassfuls mixed with lots of sugar and downed fast. I was experiencing odd hallucinations and a weirdness to my weed high. Nothing notable but at times I was filled with energy and shook and felt things running through me. It was somewhat spiritual or magickal.<BR>
<BR>
I turned off all the lights and could feel spirits. If one has seen 'Two Evil Eyes' by Romero/Argento the first tale has a scene with amazing spirit effects. I remembered this and it kind of made me feel funny, like dark and scared sort of. I think it was the Mandrake. I had some odd visuals, and relaxed for a while playing the new Game Boy. I smoked another bowl of cannabis and was all out of tea.<BR>
<BR>
I then fell asleep. The next day I woke up with diarrhea and stomach pains. I attribute this to the Mandrake, based on what I've read. It lasted for an hour or so and then I smoked some cannabis and it eased it away. As have never done Galangal or Mandrake before I don't know how much of what was what. I think it was mostly Mandrake, and at first it was the Damiana and Scullcap. I was pleasantly relaxed.
