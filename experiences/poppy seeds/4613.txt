[Erowid Note: The dosages described in this experience are confused and we were unable to sort out for certain what they actually meant.  We assume that they meant to say '30 grams (1 oz)', but then later they say that it sells for .76 per gram and the cost is $4 NZ per dose.  30 x .76 is not 4.00.  Dosage information should probably be assumed to be wrong. ]<BR>

There seems to be some confusion about whether it is possible to extract any opiates from poppy seeds bought at supermarkets. I have tried this several times before and every time I have gotten some sort of high from the tea. The recipe I have been using is as follows:<BR>
<BR>
Buy 300g (1 oz) [sic - 28g is about 1 ounce] of poppy seeds from the bulk food section of your local supermarket.<BR>
<BR>
Mix in a bowl or pot with lemon juice. It seems to be that the more lemon juice you use the better (apart from drinking it). I fill the bowl until the lemon juice is about 1 inch above the poppy seeds.<BR>
<BR>
Leave for ten minutes, stirring occasionally. <BR>
<BR>
Strain of lemon jucie. An old t-shirt works well as a strainer, but better yet is a coffee filter. Use your ingenuity.<BR>
<BR>
Drink, wait about 1 - 3 hours and by then I am usually incapable of moving more than a few meters.<BR>

The high I get off this is VERY good, but have only done this 4 times, and have zero tolerance to any opiates. I find it hard to believe that even a regular opiate user will get nothing from this, but I could be (and probably am) wrong. I live in NZ, poppy seeds sell for 76c a gram over here, about $4NZ for a 6 hour high (plus lemon juice cost). Bottled lemon juice is the easiest way to go, it costs around $4NZ a litre, enough for 1kg of poppy seeds.<BR>

There will be a better way of doing this, but the low low cost means that I can't be bothered figuring it out. Oh, and all my friends get the same effects as I do.And you WILL feel sick off this, lying down usually stops the nausea, but if I stand up during the high I usually end up throwing up. Smoking pot mixes very well with this high (as with everything... :) <BR>
Aparently you can rewash the seeds, but I haven't tried this.
