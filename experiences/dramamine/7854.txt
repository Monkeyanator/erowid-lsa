This report is on my very first experience with Dramamine. I had heard a lot about it from a few friends, and being short on cash one day and very bored, I decided to try it, I thought, 'Aw, what the hell.'<BR>
<BR>
I walked up to Rite Aid, which is a grocery/drug store, I bought 2 little bottles and a bottle of Snapple to wash it down. I took the pills in the bathroom at my house and proceeded to my friend B's house, about 15 minutes away walking, super close. I threw my purse in and climbed in the window of his bedroom, this is a very usual thing because everyone gets into B's room through the window, it is his door, and told him what I did, he said ok cool keep me filled in on how your feeling, and I said ok. It had been about a half hour since I ingested the pills and I was just kind of feeling a little light headed, like how I feel after the first cigarette of the morning. I said if this is all that happens I am going to be pissed, man was I wrong.<BR>
<BR>
I decided to lay down on his bed and he was sitting at the computer with his back to me, after another 45 minutes or so of watching TV. I looked over at him and he was staring at me (this was a hallucination) and I asked him what he was looking at, but he wasn't even staring at me, and he did hear me ask that, so he thought the question was pertaining to the web site he was looking at and he said, 'Oh, it's a Misfits fan site.' This really, really confused me because I thought he was talking about why he was looking at me. At the time I didn't realize just how out there I was, so I was just like, 'Uh, ok,' and lay back down. I few minutes later, our friend Y climbed in the window, (this was a hallucination) he didn't really. I looked up and moved over so he could get in and sit on the bed, I asked him if he was tweaking because he usually was. He said yeah and pulled out a bottle of Snapple from his pocket, the same one I had washed down my pills with. He sat it on the bed, I looked down at it and he was gone when I looked up, and when I looked back down at the Snapple and it was gone to.<BR>

B was really amused at my whole situation, and he was sitting next to me laughing in his crazy stoner laugh, and he finally choked out that I must be hallucinating and it was ok, that no one had been here. I didn't know what to say to this so I lay down and feel asleep instantly. I woke up at about 7:15 p.m., 6 hours since I had taken the dose, I had forgotten that I had taken it, and told him I would see him later, that was all I remember. Some other things could have or could have not happened unbeknownst to me.
