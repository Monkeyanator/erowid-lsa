12:oo pm I ingest 2 tbs of dry calamus in a tea. just an overall weird feeling, did notice colors were brighter overall. not a nice buzz at all.  instuctions said 1-2 tablespoons for increased energy mood enhancer. 3-6 tablespoons for ecstacy buzz.  7-10 tablespoons for lsd like buzz. 11 tablespoons for full blown hallucinations and loss of memory.<BR>

So a few days later i try two more tablespoons in a tea not much to brag about. so i waited about 2 hours and ingested 2 tablespoons more for an ecstasy like buzz...so i thought. about a half an hour later feeling very weird and i start vomiting dry heaves every 5 minutes from 2:00 -8:30 at night. it was the worst sickness i had experienced in years. i couldnt sit up i couldn't lay down, tears pouring from my eyes. as sick as you could without dying at least i thought so. <BR>
