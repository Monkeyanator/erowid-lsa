Well, I had an experience with some extremely dangerous drugs a few days ago. I used to drink a bottle of Robitussin for fun. Well, I found some concentrated DXM in pill form. My friend, 'O' and I decided to have some fun. A bottle like I used to drink had about 220 milligrams of dextromethorphan. We each took 720 milligrams. About two hours later, back at our house it hit us. I started getting some weird visuals on the wall. 'O' was zonked out and freaked out lying on the couch. We both started hearing crazy sounds. We had total loss of any motor skills. My friend 'R' paged me and asked me to come over to the tavern. I was in no shape to drive and explained this to him and he said okay.<BR>
<BR>
I finally convinced O to unfold the couch-bed so that we could both lie down. He did so and I climbed aboard. The entire room was spinning and we could not keep focus on anything. 'Just sleep it off, we thought...'<BR>

I got caught in a nasty time-loop. I experienced Hell. I thought that my basement was the only existent Universe and Jason and I were doomed to live it out in this horrible state for all eternity. God was finally punishing us for our foolish sins. I experienced the same events over and over again. Seeing my legs, leaving the bed, looking at my pager, returning to my bed, leaving my body, and then seeing my legs again. Each time I left my body, it seemed days, years, eons passed, but each time I looked at my pager only one minute had passed.<BR>
<BR>
We both thought that we were dying or very close to it. I felt my soul being ripped from my body. I tried to contain it, but my body began to strech and pull and my head started to get yanked from my neck. I could only console myself by assuring myself that we did not do enough to overdose. Intense visuals of torment. I could hear people screaming and dying. I knew my life was about to end.<BR>
<BR>
I woke up about six hours later and we were back to the ground. I was wearing a robe and the entire basement was trashed. We were still heavily high, and we spent the next hour talking about the trip. We then cleaned everything up, got some breakfast and headed to work. I am still high as write this now.<BR>

That stuff makes pure LSD seem like ginger beer. There is no comparison. DXM is by far the most intense shit I have ever done.
