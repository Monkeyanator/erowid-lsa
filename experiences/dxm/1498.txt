unconcious in a matter of 35 minutes. most intense hallunciations about the most relavant issues in my life. a midlife vision quest. totally unplanned. thought i was taking ghb. never tried dxm.  couldn't talk very well. syllables all garbeled up and hyper-stuttered. <BR>

didn't move on my own for 8 hours. then with help stumbled home. where i lay for another 15 hours. couldn't ride my skate for 3 days. vision was like looking into a broken mirror. 20 hours of this. got badly sunburned, even though i had a freind with me all the time. can't take everything into account. informed that neither breathing nor heartbeat slowed during 45min. of unconciousness. i listened to the sun. i could see pluto. i felt the edges of the universe. i watched the grass grow. and i saw the formation of conciousness through pro-creation. i could feel a loved one 9000 miles away. distances became extreamly comprehendable. all from my spot on the ground behind a track in the grass, under the sun with my poor friend at my side. wondering what had happened. <BR>

such love though. he played with me like i was 18 months old i think i was returned to infancy. well i definitely felt close to death.  i learned an immense amount. i smiled the whole time. and i wouldn't recomend that dosage to anyone.
