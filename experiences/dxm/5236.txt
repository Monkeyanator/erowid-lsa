Well the night started off on a bad note, I found out that I was going to a rehab centre where i lived, to get some help, I had been doing a wide variety of drugs for about 3 years. After hearing the news of my future I decided to go for a walk. While walikng around I decided to go to the local drug store and get some sucrets (I had done dxm only a few times before). I bought two packs for only $3.29 each(it was all they had left) <BR>

I finally found myself at home again, and I waited until about 11 pm to talk all 36 sucrets. I didn't mind them one bit, tasted much better than any cough syrup. After about an hour I started feel a little buzz, then anohter hour later, it wasin full gear. Everytime I moved my head, I would feel sick (like motion sickness) I tried to listen to some music but that only made it worse. I could feel the sound waves hitting my brain, moving it in every direction. <BR>

I went outside for some fresh air and I had a smoke out there. I closed my eyes hopefully to see some cev's but nothing came. When I opened my eyes back up, it seemed everything was rushing away from my. The house, the street light, even someone walking down the street. This made me feel sick, so I ran to the bathroom and proceeded to puke out some of the drugs, I puked two more times that night. The buzz never went away until the morning. I felt no side effects at all the next day.  Also everytime I had a smoke I would puke, strange coincidence?...
