I am writing this two days after my first experience with DXM.  Monday i went to work as usual.  The school nurse called and my little boy was sick so i went to get him and some medicine at the store.  Well i been researching the DXM trip and had an afternoon to spare so i decided to go for it.  I bought the cough syrup and after my son was tucked in, i downed the 4 oz bottle (around 1pm) and waited for something to happen. 2Pm nothing happening yet so i smoked a joint.  3Pm came and i definately felt something.  I felt like a fucking robot.  I was freaking out because i could tell i was tripping (my pupils were very dialated.)  <BR>

My son woke up by now and he just thought i was sick like him.  At this point i really did wish i was sick and not tripping like this.  I go to the restroom.  At this point i am now peaking.  Thinking if i throw up i will get it out of my system i proceed to stick my fingers down my throat.  No luck.  I have to pick up my husband by six so i figured maybe i could sleep it off until then.  No luck.  I tossed and turned.  No visuals or anything crazy i just felt like i was loosing my soul and turning into a robot.  This continued until the next morning.  I awoke and went to the restroom.  I am still walking like a robot and feel not like me.  At this point i am just ready for it to fucking end. Realizing i cannot go to work in this state i call in sick.  First part of the day i sleep deep until about noon.  Still feel the same.  By now i am beginning to wonder if i will ever return to my normal state.  <BR>

Well that day passed also and now it is wednesday.  I came to work today but i still do not feel like myself yet.  That shit was very scary.  I have done alot of drugs in my life but none that made me feel like that.  I will never to that again. Simply as that.
