I normally take Robitussin maximum strength cough and take at least 8 ounces.  The stuff messes me up real good.  But its not the initial experience that I love about Dxm its the after affects.  I've been so chilled out lately.  I'm no longer depressed and mean to everyone.  I love my life and am able to supress my desire to take more Dxm.  I now take it just to add some excitement to my life, before it removed my depression.  I dont encourage it for everyone but I gotta say that if youve lived an unhappy well being for a long time you gotta try it.  It may work for you cuz it worked for me and all of my friends.
