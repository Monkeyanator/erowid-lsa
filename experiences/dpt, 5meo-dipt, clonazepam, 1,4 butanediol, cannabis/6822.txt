Ealier in the day I had already insufflated 25 mg DPT an hour prior to attending my cousin's First Communion. I have not been to church for many years now. I am very experienced with this substance and thought it might help access my lost 'religiousness'. I felt my self tapping into a calmness I didn't expect to encounter. The priest had a soft whitish-green aura about him. And my cousin standing there in his little suit and tie, just exuding happiness. He is truly happy to be receiving communion. I remember my own communion, nervously chewing the stale wafer, wondering if they came in other flavors. I remember imagining a wafer covered in cheeze doodle dust...I felt warm, positive. <br>

   The stained glass windows were beautiful, the sun sparkling through, casting little rainbows on the hardwood floor. Singing with such a large group was exhilerating, freeing. I felt I was getting more out of the mass than the regular attendees. I could see the tiredness glazing on many eyes. I could see people fidgetting with their keys, watching the clock. Whispering to each other. I felt like I was in highschool again. The sermon made me feel like a student listening to a teacher. I wanted to shout aloud! This was merely a pretense of religion, very superficial. No one was sharing anything, except pew space and anxious stares. Why couldn't they feel the way I was, coursing with solemnity and spirituality? I the undercover pagan in their midst? I understand now why the Temple of the Ture Inner Light (mentioned by Shulgin) actually uses DPT as a sacrament. <br>

Later on that night, the real experiment took place:<br>
<UL><br>
<LI>6pm: One human monkey was administered a 5mg oral dose of 5meo-DIPT. Onset was observed at 35 mins. Slight chest energy. Mood elevation is perhaps the most noticable effect. I am giddy for sure. Smirking.</LI><br>
<LI>7pm:  Typical 5meo-DiIPT pleasant body high. Touch feels good. I go outside and sit in the fresh cut grass. I am tickled by the blades of grass. I enjoy watching clouds move across the sky. It's getting dark and I am hoping to see stars. For the past two nights I have seen shooting stars after only sitting for 15 mins. I live way up in the mountains, there is very little light pollution here. I notice slight visual enhancements, the soft orange fading into lavender sunset is extra colorful, or more likely I am just more aware of the fade between the colors. Many shades I don't have a name for.</LI><br>
<LI>8pm: 30mg DPT insufflated. This is where things got really interesting. This is a special synergy. I feel exhuberant! Visuals were mounting within moments. Things began to swirl and morph in a dance of sparks. I was seeing random color bursts and streaks in the darkness. Tree limbs swayed in the wind, forming endless mesh-lattice works. The tactile effects had me feeling as if I was melding with the tree I had chosen to rest against. It was very calming. Visions of the Greenman sprung to mind. I found myself apologizing in my thoughts for the recent destruction of much  mountainside behind where I live. It seems the world needs another golf course. I am thinking of the part in GOONIES where Mikey says that he hopes they build a sand trap where his house is, and NEVER GET THEIR BALLS OUT! I feel the same.</LI><br>
<LI>9pm:  Visuals are very intricate and artful. When I stare at something, it starts to vibrate and is soon part of a whorling dance of electrons. It is an awe inspiring view. I can feel THE FLOW. I am in its current. Waves of tactile pleasure pass over me. My body is full of childish energy and I find myself dancing alone in the woods in the dark to the music in my head. This is such an awesome place to be. My own personal rave with nature.</LI><br>
<LI>10pm: .5mg clonazepam to settle a slight, underlying anxiety that that has begun to form. My mood is still locked in the positive. The roses I order for my mother came early and I was unable to wait. I had to give them to my mom right then!  They were 'Movie Star Roses,' which gave her a good laugh. I felt like Aldous Huxley as I stared into the flowers, at how alive they seemed(for now). Exquisite. I felt very grateful towards my mother. All the years of protecting my brother and I from an abusive alcoholic father, of suffering abuse herself. And now she is free, independent, and beautiful. I can see a child's face in her visage. I am lucky to have such a strong and wonderful woman as my mother. Today is also my Grandmother's 75th birthday! I am equally moved by her, my second mother. I have hugged her at least twenty times today. It has been an eventful day to say the least.</LI><br>
<LI>11:30: Things have dropped of considerably. MJ has a noticable jumpstart effect with the visuals. Although, they have reverted to strange geometries and tube thingies. More chaotic. I feel calm from the clonazepam. I decide to mix up 5ml 1,4B with OJ. It adds a contented feeling, a slight drunken euphoria. Today was a complete success.</LI><br>
