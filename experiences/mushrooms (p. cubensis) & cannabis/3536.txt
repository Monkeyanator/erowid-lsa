I've been a pothead for some time now, and the intensely interesting experience of Cannabis inspired, even the first time I tried it, the desire to experiment with psychedelics.  I, however, have never been a real participant in local drug culture and was also, for various reasons, a pariah among the druggie clan at my school, thus significantly limiting my chances for further experimentation.  However, since I became best friends with another stoner at the beginning of the summer, I have had the chance to experience first MDMA and now Magic Mushrooms.<BR>
<BR>
Me and my friend (I'll just call him O.S. for 'other stoner') had been trying to get ahold of some shrooms for quite some time, and eventually lucked out when a friend of his mom gave us a half ounce, mostly stems, for free.  I had been told that a half of an eighth of shrooms would be sufficient, but the hookup in question advised us definitely to eat a quad (1/4 oz.) each.  We arrived at the designated tripping location, his parents' ad studio, a massive old-school industrial building.  I brought with me my usual drug essentials, such as my CD collection, a laptop chock-full of techno MP3's, some bud, and of course some cigarettes.<BR>
<BR>
We tried several methods to down the foul-tasting fungus, and eventually settled on cooking burgers and covering them with shroomz and ketchup.  This went down perfectly for me, although O.S. was almost on the verge of vomiting.  We set aside a small bathroom as a 'hot-box' room where we could smoke weed in a very confined room so as to intensify the high, and went in there with all of our supplies.<BR>
<BR>
Neither of us knew shit about shrooms, so we waited, alone, for some effects to started.  Both of us previously had experimented with MDMA, and about 30 minutes after we ingested the shrooms, we started to experience a lot of MDMA-like effects.  Tactile sensation felt great, there was very mild hallucination (objects were bright, etc) and there was generally a very dreamy high.  I was kind of disappointed until O.S. suddenly started shrieking, laughing, and pointing to objects on the wall.  He told me how the walls were disappearing and how objects were floating around, and I knew finally that we had ingested real shrooms.  Now I've always been someone for whom drugs take a while to work, and I had to take a shit, so I went off half-way across the building to perform this essential bodily function.  Comically, my trip started mid-shit.  I was staring at the bathroom door in front of me as it began to warp and fold, and then I looked at the light above me and it was like a glimpse down a tunnel into heaven, complete with flying radiating sparks.  I was starting to shroom!  Of course, this made finishing up my job much more complicated, and I started to receive panicked cell-phone calls from O.S., who was by that time tripping balls, telling me to get back to our home-base in the hotbox room.  He eventually walked over to the bathroom, and swung open the door.  I had a momentary start and screamed, until I realized that this was indeed my friend.  We went back to the hot-box and that's when we glimpsed...<BR>
<BR>
CHAOS.<BR>
<BR>
As I said earlier, our goal had been to smoke bud in the bathroom.  This proved to be impossible.  Doing ANYTHING proved to be a formidable task.  Everything was too trippy, all of my thoughts were going in approximately 20 directions, and it was impossible to focus on such simple concepts as bong hits.  I would like to note that this was about an hour after taking the shrooms.  O.S. started to complain about how all of his thought patterns were going in cycles, and I started to notice that too, which was immensely interesting for me because it mimicked my first experience with pot.  My first experience with bud had the same 'i can't function' despair, along with the 'my mind is going in circles' feeling.  However, since I recognized this for being a natural part of trying a new drug, I chilled out and started telling my friend to just chill with the trip and see where it takes us.<BR>
<BR>
It took us to CHAOS.  UTTER chaos.  Over the course of the next hour, while we were attempting to take a bong hit and also finish the last couple crumbs of shrooms we succeeded in:<BR>
<BR>
breaking the armrest right off of a $500 chair<BR>
dropping my lighter in the toilet<BR>
destroying an expensive commercial light<BR>
breaking the slide of the bong<BR>
spilling coca-cola EVERYWHERE.<BR>
<BR>
this was too much and we needed to leave the hot-box and went back to the lounge where my computer was set up and there were many couches and carpets on which to chill and zone out.  at this point, I decided that this inability to do anything was an integral component of the trip, and that obsessing over our ineptitude was completely contrary to just going along with the flow and exploring our own consciousnesses.  I told O.S. once again to chill out and focused on the amazing visuals in the room.  Carpet was warped and flowing, wooden boards on the ceiling were merging and breaking apart in a liquid fashion... i looked under a table and saw the wall move 5 feet back.  interesting shit.  at the same time, we began having a deep conversation about the ongoing trends in our drug use and decided it was time to cut back on our pot use, which had been getting out of control especially for O.S. but also for me.  O.S. and I also decided to play around with my computer, and found that it was impossible to find the cursor, letters on the screen were merging, and typing was the most complicated task in the world.  We poured our minds out onto the keyboard and created the most interesting rambling piece of shit the world has ever seen, which is actually quite to our credit given that we kept reversing the spelling of words.  Regardless, once we were sufficiently chilled out and listening to trippy Jungle, we decided to move upstairs.  A note about music, however... I found that on shrooms I related to music in ways I never had before.  Pot often caused my perception of the world, especially of moving objects, to come into alignment with the rhythms of whatever I was listening to, but music on shrooms directed my thoughts, as well.  My ideas and conceptions, and sometimes my visuals, moved with the beat in an intensely interesting way.<BR>

Upstairs, there were two, mostly unused, attic spaces, for the most part without lighting.  These were massive lofts, a veritable sea of columns and dark floor, and proved to be the most interesting part of the trip.  See, this evening was Halloween weekend, and the overwhelming theme was indeed 'orange'.  Orange light from the street was streaming through fogged windows and illuminating the loft floor.  We put on some drum n' bass and started moving throughout the sea of columns.  Every single square enclosed by four columns seemed like a separate room and I felt like a video game character.  I danced throughout the floor, liquiding (a rave dance wherein you move your hands in a liquid pattern), with lighted cigarettes sufficing for glowsticks.  I enjoyed an awesome surge of positive, happy, energy and danced throughout the attic with a big smile on my face.  Also, in the darker portions of the room, walking forward felt like the floor was warping down into an infinite abyss.  Quite fun.<BR>
<BR>
Once back downstairs, I continued to dance and explored my visuals.  I don't know why, but dancing felt GREAT.  It was a total positive, exuberant, happy rave-like feeling, and I just couldn't stop liquiding around the lounge.  We started to come down a tad and decided that it was now possible to hit the bong, and we actually did manage to rip a few in the hot-box.  We then repeated some of the things we had done before, such as dancing upstairs, and I bumped 10 mgs of ritalin nasally to try to extend my trip a little bit, thought it didn't do anything substantial.  Upstairs again, O.S. discovered a wheelable dolly and we had much fun wheeling each other around the grand cavernous room at high speeds.  Everything was trippy, spooky, and immensenly fun.  The Halloween atmosphere was unavoidable; the entire studio felt like an immensely cool and interesting haunted house, and we looked at spooky things with a smile and a laugh.  We eventually did some clean-up, and I had a beer and some more bud with the hope to fall asleep, given that I had to be home at 8:00 the next morning.  I would say we both came down fully about 5 hours after we felt the first effects, which was not disappointing at all.  Needless to say I wasn't able to get to sleep (probably thanks to the ritalin), and I have just been keeping myself up with more of it until I can finally fall asleep tonight.<BR>
<BR>
When I look back on my first psychedelic trip, though, I feel that the glimpse into chaos and into myself was one of the most interesting experiences I have ever had.  I also was overjoyed at the positive vibes I got from the shrooms; shrooming for me was like the way most people described ecstacy... positive, happy, empathetic, energetic... except with intense visuals.  O.S. and I are probably going to shroom again, maybe in combination with MDMA (hippy-flip), and we have been going over the idea of trying LSD.  This experience had, obviously, its positives and negatives, and only got good once we abandoned our plans and hopes for the evening and just let shit flow.  As advice to people shrooming in the future... don't try to put yourself in any situation you might not be up to.  Don't plan on doing anything, don't try to hold to any predetermined schedule.  Just have a satisfactory trip... shrooms are chaos, not order, so don't try to defy the essence of Psilocybin because you will just get unpleasant vibes.  Now we have to focus on paying for the damage we did to various items at the studio, and we will probably never be able to use it as a trip venue again.  Meh... such is life.
