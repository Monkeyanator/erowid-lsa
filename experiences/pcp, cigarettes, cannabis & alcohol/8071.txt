Just today my friend and I, who were supposed to get dust at a party one day during the beginning of the school year got a chance to try this drug for the first time. The call came and my friend who asked if we wanted to go to Lego land; he had a hookup. We had a few beers earlier and went to get our cigs dipped. We got 2 dipped for 4 people. We went around the block and smoked 'em.<BR>
<BR>
The first thing I noticed is the smell, like chemicals, it tastes too and as we lit up the cigarette it flamed up a sec. The dip tasted of a slight bitter and alcoholic (rubbing) fume taste. After the first dip the people who already had more substances in them (weed, beer, valium) felt it fast. By 10 minutes I felt light headed and floaty. I felt sort of stoned with a lack of feeling of the body when not focusing on it. Not a numbness, just like its not there.<BR>
<BR>
We smoked some bongs because it was recommended to us to smoke after finishing the dippie. Weed definitely helped the dissociated feeling and the high stoniness was increased a lot. We smoked the next cigarette and the dust was increased over the high again.<BR>
<BR>
A little later we went back to the comfortable, familiar environment of my friends garage where we chill and jam and smoked a blunt with a crill of valium crushed up lacing it and I was in orbit. However I didn't know this earlier tonight, when I read that valium actually is useful in countering people experiencing convulsions or high doses (overdose?) of dust. That's when I decided to write this up because there isn't much about dust out there.<BR>

After the smoking was done I peaking at about the 1 hour mark. The euphoric energized-yet-happy with sitting feeling came down slowly and I just felt high 45 minutes later. I would not compare this to tripping on acid or shrooms or rolling at all. I would have to say if your lungs are shot from smoking cigarettes and weed you should really recuperate from them before you throw this harsh chemical into your precious lungs.
