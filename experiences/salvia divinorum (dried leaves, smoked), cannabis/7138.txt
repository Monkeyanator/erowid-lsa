Setting: I went to someone's house with friend A, to buy some marijauna with a friend from his job.  When we got there, I found out that one of A's friends had bought salvia on EBay, of all places.  I decided to smoke some because I never had.<BR>
<BR>
Time 00:00:00 <BR>
(6:30 PM): In B's room, I smoke 2 big bowls of salvia in a bong, hitting hard, because I was told 2 bowls was what I needed to get fucked up.  I didn't feel anything right at the end and panicked, so I smoked another 1/2 bowl, then I felt a rush.  As my head tried to recover (very sudden onset, within 2 minutes I'd say)I have the feeling of 'weight' heavily in the bottom half of each of my appendages.  <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Time 00:00:01:<BR>
I'm told to stand up, and I feel very odd.  I'm told 'you're depth perception is all wierd, right?' but it doesn't really register because i'm much more in touch of internal systems than external stimuli.<BR>
<BR>
Time 00:00:04:<BR>
I have a funny feeling that this is stronger than what I bargained for, and a little twinge of anxiety turns into panic that will ultimatly come and go intermittantly, but never really becomes anything more than annoying.  Alternatly there is some spiritual feeling of joy, but the body load is uncomfortable, and it's mixed with anxiety.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Time 00:00:10:<BR>
B and his friend C have left to get me marijauna.  We go out to A's car and wait, but C leaves the door open and as they leave a pet rotweiller of B's comes out and snarls, scaring us into the car (that thing is a vicious bastard when it wants to be).  B puts on the radio, and I realize that the patterns I normally enjoy in music on pot are there, but there is more a sense of annoyance at them than a sense of pleasure or amusement.<BR>
<BR>
Time 00:00:30:<BR>
D shows up, she's supposed to meet B and C to get them some other stuff, and gets pissed when they don't show up as soon as they said they would.  We walk in their direction, do a loop and miss them on the way back.  All This walking is annoying.  We get weed, make a stop and head back to my house at 00:02:00 after a breif delay inside the house waiting for C, and I'm trying to talk and I feel burned out, it makes me sound confusing to myself, so I stop.<BR>
<BR>
00:03:00 We end up back at my house and we smoke some decent marijauna.  I just feel stoned, but then A wants to try salvia, so he smokes up and trips out.  He's only taken acid once, at a lose dose, and has no other psychadellic expirience other than pot.  He really acted like he was tripping, he kept saying when he ate something, he could make it taste like whatever he wanted, and stuff like that.  We smoke more pot, and he falls asleep.<BR>
<BR>
Ultimatly, salvia seemed to me to be a solid mixture of the threshold effects of LSD, with some marijauna-like trippy effects, and a body load that was pretty unique (dissapated quickly in the first hour) but felt like a mix of N2O with LSD might (only in terms of the body load, not the mental effect).  All in all, this was sort of interesting, and felt like it would have been a lot more intense if I'd managed to get two or three times as much as I'd smoked into my system (this salvia smells TERRIBLE, it was actually smelling up a bag of weed, by just being stored in the same vicinity, and it's a rank, offemsive smell.)<BR>
<BR>
However, while it felt like a drug that would take me through the veil into self, it would not do so in a way that would be useful or meaningful to me, with side effects of annoyance and paranoia.
