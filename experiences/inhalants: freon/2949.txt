Our understanding of the literature is that there is no such thing as safe recreational use of volatile solvents, aerosols and other street inhalants : their psychoactive effects are inseparable from nerve and organ damage. We have chosen to include these reports to help document the real world use of inhalants, but their inclusion is not intended to imply that they are anything but dangerous.]</span> <br/>

I had heard from a mutual friend that huffing freon could produce a very good but short lasting 'buzz'.  After learning and studying on how to retrieve the freon from air conditioners, my best friend and I tried it.  It's sweet, tastes almost like honey.  We were huffing in our 'party barn' with hard wood floors and a pool table.  I took in about 4 huffs the first time and handed the bag to my friend.  I started to almost feel as if I was falling asleep and sought the nearest chair.  As I awoke from what seemed to be an hour long trip and saw my friend crawling around like a dog I found myself laughing.  Well, we both 'sobered' up and I tried it again. <br/>
<br/>
This time I was leaning against the pool table and kept huffing and huffing, telling my friend to grab the bag when I closed my eyes.  The last thing I remember is my face boucing off the side of the pool table.  I woke up in a ear piercing scream that seemed to be coming from my mouth.  And to my surprise it was.  Laying stomach down on the hard wood floor, my chin propped up.  I couldn't move, it was as if I had lost all control over my muscles.  My friend came over and tried to help me up.  When he touched me I screemed in bloody murder.  All-in-all, I had huffed about 10-15 hits, we think, and passed out slamming into the pool table on my travels downward and then onto the floor.  I broke my neck and have nerve damage for the rest of my life.  Unless you're a complete dumbass, PLEASE, do not do this stuff.  Looking for a cheap high, just forget freon, its a bad scene.
