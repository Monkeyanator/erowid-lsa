I tried smoking wormwood out of a bong a little while ago.  To my knowledge this hasn't been tried before.  I took three tokes, and felt a mild cannabis-like high.  This lasted for about 1.5-2 hours.  It wasn't that great and gave me a headache.  Possibly more needs to be smoked, but on the whole it was a disapointing experience.  I would stick to pot.
