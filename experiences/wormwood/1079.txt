On a number of occasions I have brewed wormwood tea. Sometimes I add fresh catnip--generally I add fresh mint. 1/8 cup, more or less fresh chopped wormwood leaves. Often I'll add honey--wormwood is bitter.<BR>

It's interesting to share tea with a friend. The conversation gradually slows to a trickle. Occasional words punctuate the silence. Thoughts stop intruding. It's enough to simply sit together. <BR>

No groovy lights, no sense of lethargy. I could direct myself to action when required. But left to my own devices I get very quiet. The thoughts slow to a trickle. And then seem to stop. For long periods.<BR>

TV ruins the experience.
