First of all, a warning to all first time users.  Many of the reports we have read have made Dex out to be some sort of psychodelic trip<BR>
drug.  IT SIMPLY ISN'T.  Don't do this drug, (in large doses) if you don't want to be (and the only word for it is) SMACKED. <BR>
<BR>
We have done this drug in a series of different settings, forms, and quantities.  One bad experience was spent vomitting on a street corner<BR>
off of Robitussin DM, after drinking about half of the bottle.  There is a 'puke-agent' in the Robitussin, so I beg of you:  DON'T EVER<BR>
ROBO-TRIP! <BR>
<BR>
The better forms of Dex come in pill form that you may buy at your local pharmacy, (i.e. K-MART, WALLGREENS or RITE-AID) such as Coricidin<BR>
Cough and Cold and also Drixoral, though its hard to find (usually only found in Canada.) <BR>
<BR>
Our best experience was together and some more excellent advice for this drug is DO IT WITH A FRIEND, someone you love and trust, has Dexed<BR>
before, and/or will be able to handle it. <BR>
<BR>
We'd taken some bunk ecstasy pills the night before called YIN-YANG, though we'd never heard of it before.  We bought it at a club in a<BR>
state of desparation.  We took one each, (not a lot for people that roll a lot) and waited near the speakers for the euphoria to kick in. <BR>
As we listened to the bass mixed by one of the DJ's we'd been waiting for all night, we noticed our liquiding skills, (i.e. dancing skills)<BR>
weren't getting any better.  It had been two hours, 4AM, we weren't feeling anything yet, and we were tired.  Basically, we said fuck it and<BR>
went home to our apartment and fell asleep. <BR>
Fast forward...Next night, with nothing better to do and as a favor to a friend, Gigi and I went to a house party with a bunch of stupid<BR>
high-school lushes as the typical guests.  We needed something hard to survive the agony of such a setting to spend a Saturday night.  AH,<BR>
DEX, the perfect escape drug.  If you need to get smacked, there is nothing better than Dex to do it for you.  We rounded up two big glasses<BR>
of water, plopped ourselves down on an available couch and began downing the glossy red pills.  Gigi took 14 Coricidin because, after all,<BR>
she was an experienced user, having ROBO-TRIPPED at least twice and pill-tripped many-a-time.  I, however, having a very low tolerance for<BR>
all such drugs, took 12. <BR>
We sat, listening to the not-so-soothing sounds of the SEX PISTOLS while we watched the pseudo-punk high-schoolers take swigs of Jack and<BR>
smashing beer bottles, screaming and laughing each time.  We were maybe the only two girls there and certainly the only party-kids, (ravers)<BR>
there.  I felt drowsy and comfy on what seemed like a plush red velvet couch and rested my head on Gigi's comfy lap.  Soon there-after, my<BR>
body was heavy and I was only half in this world and Gigi was my cocoon.  I was completely oblivious to the screaming fools all around me<BR>
until I felt the weight of an arm on my shoulder.  I opened my eyes to find an obnoxious boy asking me if I was okay, repetitively.  'She's<BR>
fine,' Gigi told him, 'She's just...SMACKED.'  Yes, that I was. <BR>
<BR>
I was very decisive about where the good and bad energy was and decided that our whereabouts in the room were NOT good energy.  So Gigi took<BR>
me on a walk, a slow walk, down a long distorted hallway into a room with a bed as well as no people, which definitely contributed to its<BR>
'good energy' aspects.  We collapsed into the bed and sunk into eachother's arms because it seemed it was the only thing to do.  Shortly<BR>
after Gigi explained that it wasn't hitting her very hard and she needed to take some more.  She finished off her box of Coricidin, taking<BR>
the last two red pills and making her dosage an even 16. <BR>
<BR>
There weren't any 'trippy' images to be described at all at that point.  As soon as the Dex hit her, our roles seemed to have reversed and<BR>
it was me holding her in my lap, stroking her hair, and waiting for someone to harrass us so I could protect her.  Finally, the attackers<BR>
barged into our haven and interrogated us with the same pointless question: 'Are you okay,' 'Is she okay,' 'Are you guys okay?' <BR>
AAARRRGGGHHHH.  'She's fine, SHe's okay, I'm okay, We're okay.  We're just smacked.'  The only reason I can think that they kept badgering<BR>
us was because they were drunkin' fools or they thought we were freaks on heroine.  It finally came to this: two smacked girls, trying to<BR>
scream orders at them, 'Please, just leave us alone.  Go away...' but the screams just came out as groans, which I think, must have scared<BR>
them because they finally left the room and we were alone at last with only traces of bad energy left on the side of the room with the door.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It felt like hours and hours had past and neither of us were sure if we'd been sleeping or not.  I tried to tell Gigi, who was holding me<BR>
now in her lap, how it felt like I was in a different universe, but the words, again, came out as groans.  But she nodded at the moans I<BR>
uttered because she knew.  She knew because she too was in this other universe; she too was SMACKED. <BR>
<BR>
There are too many instances of the night to possibly describe all of them, but eventually our host, one of my good friends felt sorry for<BR>
us in the state we were in and lead us to her mother's unoccupied bedroom.  The room was dark and mysterious and the enormous bed was our<BR>
new home.  We plunged into it and continued in our state of obliviousness, still not sure if we were asleep.  We cuddled and held our<BR>
stuffed animals, (yes, they are teletubbies).  The room was black with no traces of 3-dimensional objects outside of the bed and the only<BR>
thing I can think to describe the settings is 'shadows and corners.' <BR>
<BR>
At one point I remember Gigi whispering something to me in a desparate voice and she was gone, but not before taking about 6 minutes to<BR>
'walk' out of the room.  I say 'walk' because what she was doing was certainly not like any walking I've ever seen.  She was wearing big,<BR>
(BIG) pants and sort of tip-toing with hugely tall steps, her knees reaching her stomach every step.  Yet while she was doing this, she was<BR>
going less than a mile an hour and the slow-motioned walk was a sort of mouse dance, with the precision of a ballet dancer.  I explained to<BR>
her later what she looked like and she recalled that she wasn't sure if she was walking normally, but she thought she was. <BR>
What seemed like an hour later, after thinking about it for some time, I managed to gather all my strength and emerge from the bed on a hunt<BR>
for my lost friend.  I don't think I did the 'mouse-dance' walk, but I can't be sure.  Down the long corridor again, I came upon a series of<BR>
doors which I decided Gigi was NOT behind, so I continued and found the room in which our adventure had begun.  Nirvana was playing,<BR>
(although I found out later, Nirvana hadn't played that night at all) and I managed to ask some of the drunken fools where Gigi was. <BR>
Somehow I found her in a bathroom I'd never seen before.  I sat beside her next to the toilet and saw what she had come to this bathroom<BR>
for.  The walls were a glistening white and the room screamed CLEAN.  It was the  only room in the house that wasn't black and fuzzy and<BR>
dirty in some way.  She told me that she needed to be in this room because it had 'good vibes' and I agreed.  She also told me how proud of<BR>
herself she was because she hadn't thrown up, as she'd intended to do, after taking 16. <BR>
Later, when we were back in our black universe of the bed, we were cradling eachother in still limbs and realized our bare sweaty feet were<BR>
dancing rhytmically together in a sort of repetitive motion.  If you've ever done 'e' you know what this feels like.  The idea struck me all<BR>
at once and I realized that the ecstasy we hadn't felt from last night was kicking in with the Dex.  You might not believe me but I've<BR>
rolled enough to know that the feeling was definitely ecstasy.  We held eachother closely and in what words we could actually say, confessed<BR>
our heart-felt love for one another.  It was incredible.  There we were, two almost dead girls in a bed that was the only thing that existed<BR>
in a black universe holding eachother.  We couldn't move anything but our feet. <BR>
<BR>
Throughout the night people would flee in and out of the room, and because we weren't 'SMACKED' anymore, only very very fucked up, we told<BR>
them if we could stay or leave, (DEX is a very decisive drug.  Either something has good vibes or it doesn't and the things that have bad<BR>
vibes MUST be destroyed.)  Two of our drunkin' friends, we decided, had very good vibes and we made them get in bed with us and cuddle.  I'm<BR>
sure they thought we were out of our minds, but we didn't care, they had good energy and we loved them. <BR>
<BR>
Basically, the 'trip'(if you can call it that) lasted for about 10 hours.  6 of these hours were spent in a complete state of 'smackedness,'<BR>
and rest very fucked up.  I was constantly trying to think of a way to describe the experience while I was drugged and finally explained it<BR>
felt that I was home in a strange lost world trying to find something that I kept losing or forgetting on my mission.  I later compared it<BR>
to the movie 'DARK CITY' because thats exactly what DEX is like only much more distorted. <BR>
<BR>
The next day was a total nightmare.  We could not talk expressively and kept referring to ourselves as 'CRACK-WHORES' because thats the only<BR>
way we could describe our state of appearance and feelings.  CRACK-WHORE. CRACK-WHORE. <BR>
ADVICE: <BR>
Dex is a great 'getting smacked' kind of drug.  Don't do it if you're expecting some life-altering sort of psychodelic trip-drug.  Its not<BR>
that at all.  If you need to escape, completely escape, for one night, DEX is for you.  We love it, sometimes.  Its not something you can do<BR>
often.  For about a week after the 'trip,' your pupils will be anything but normal.  They'll go from being non-exitant to covering your<BR>
entire iris, and all at random times.  In the week following, both of us experienced flashbacks, one very unpleasant experience in a math<BR>
class where I couldn't subtract 9 from 16 and finally decided that the answer must be 3.  My math teacher is still questioning why i am in<BR>
his 'honors' class.  However the rest of the flashbacks were relatively harmless.
