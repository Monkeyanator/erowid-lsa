I have experienced dxm multiple times before my most recent. Every time i got a good buzz, but i wanted something more. I had read that the more you take, the more messed up you get. So i decided that instead of the usual 8 coricidan pills i would take (containing CPM), i took 16.<BR>

I was at home and was planning to just watch movies and enjoy the trip. I took 10 pills and 45 min later i was starting to feel the full effects. Soon after this i took the remaining 6. 1/2 hour later i was feeling the effects of both doses. This time, unlike others, i felt much more pronounced auditory hallucinations. For example, i kept people talking behind me but i would turn and nobody would be there. Some of the familier effects were also there but much stronger. While looking at the computer screen, it seemed to be a liquid and would keep oozing everywhere, but if i blinked it would be normal again. When i tried to stand up i was very unbalanced and felt quite detached from myself. It felt almost as if i was trying to control my body through my mind and is difficult to explain, the closest i can say is that it is simaler to playing a video game and your body is inside the game while your mind is controlling it. These effects were actually quite pleasant and they lasted the extent of the experience until i dozed off.<BR>

I have heard from many people that coricidans are really bad and you shouldn't use them, but they never gave me trouble. I am not recommending them, it might just be me that they don't affect negatively, just research anything as much as you can before you do it.
