I took 35mg the first time i did it.  i got a calm peaceful trippy feeling and no visuals.  i was dissappointed and took ghb so i could sleep.  then i took 55mg a couple weeks later.  I didn't get any visuals again, aside from slight distortions (similar to what is normal after smoking weed).  I really liked the feeling it gave me, and took some ghb about T+4 in.  i had a really great body high with a good trip mindset, just no visuals.  it was fun, but not worth the money to me.  i got better visuals from AMT (not strong visuals, but I did get some, when I took 100mg of AMT at least).<BR>

i didnt get much nausea, and it was just a good feeling, but the lack of visuals disappointed me.
