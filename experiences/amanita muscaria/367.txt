<LI>Zero logic impairment (fully able to play logic games competitively, do math, etc.) </li> <br>
<LI>Suggestibility (Easy to wander off into unsolicited conversation)</li> <br>
<li>Conversational weirdness (Difficulty picking 'the right word' (A feeling of not being able to express oneself 'properly.' nobody else noticed this however.)  </li><br>
<LI>Minor hallucinosis (if you could call it that. he could not actually point out something and say, 'there, _that moved_.' it just SEEMED like stuff was moving. note: there was an earthquake at about the time he was having such thoughts.)  </li><br>
<br>
