After reading parts of Wasson's SOMA, I was curious to try fly agaric for myself, to see what effects it might have.  I was a little apprehensive because I'd heard that some people have had less-than-pleasant experiences (nausea, profuse sweating, drowsiness, etc.).  But I thought the benefits might outweigh any drawbacks.<BR>

I picked a small mushroom, for two reasons:  first, they are said to be more active; second, I didn't want to overdo it, not knowing what might happen.  I let it dry for a week or so in my closet, which may seem like a strange place, but it had been raining, and I wanted it to dry properly.  It shrank considerably; I was able to roll it up into a kind of ball and, after letting it soften in my mouth, swallow it whole.  I didn't chew it because I thought I might avoid nausea that way.<BR>

I made sure to do it in a secluded spot, a very beautiful spot, called Redwood Grove.  I knew that I would be alone there to do anything I pleased:  write, sing, laugh, throw up, jump around and talk to trees.  However, the trip, if it can be called that, was very mild.  I never felt out of control.  There were some side effects:  I felt a fairly sharp pain in my groin and lower abdomen, but I was able to alleviate it with regular breathing.  Also, I noticed that I was sweating more than I would have normally and that my vision was not as acute.  Specifically, I couldn't focus on distant objects.  At one point, I was hiking out of the grove and saw the moon over the ridge to my right.  It appeared to me as a bright blur of light, and I couldn't make out any of its features (the craters and mountains we see as the Man in the Moon).  It was just a blob in the sky.  Distant lights in houses below were similarly blurry.  My vision later corrected itself.<BR>

Overall, it was milder and more uneventful than I expected.  It's hard for me to say just how it affected me:  I don't know that I was any more aware, or that I saw or heard things that I wouldn't have without the mushroom (heightened senses).  I think I may have become more contemplative, but that will happen to anyone who spends four hours among Redwood trees.  Still, I felt a kind of communion with the natural world, which should happen anytime we consume something that is of the earth but often doesn't.<BR>

<!--I would recommend that anyone interested in exploring altered states of consciousness try fly agaric.  It has been demonized somewhat, and I think people who would like to try it have been scared off by reports of poisoning and bad trips.  As long as you start small and surround yourself with beauty (find a peaceful, pretty place), you'll be okay.  I would suggest listening to music, if possible; I've heard that it's enhanced and did notice that I seemed to be in tune, so to speak, with what little music I had the chance to listen to (on the drive home, still under the influence, vision still blurry).  -->
