Put 10 grams of powdered, non-grade-A Amanita powder into 24 capsules.<BR>
<BR>
t -1 hour - took 1 dramamine tablet.<BR>
t0 - Swallowed the caps all at once on an empty stomach.<BR>
t1 - Vision blurred; tended to relax to near-focus only.  Extreme salivation, extreme sweating, soggy all around.  Showered.  Prepared oatmeal to nibble to hold off possible nausea.<BR>
t2-t6 - waited and waited, in this swamp, but the mental aspects never appeared.  No nausea.  Disappointing.  What to do with many, many more sub-grade A.M. capsules.<BR>
<BR>
Warning: this caused swelling under tonsils, for two days.  Worse, this caused something like an ear infection which lasted 1 month and continues.  Want to take some metallic orange-gold grade-A caps, but afraid of ear problems.  This material must be the most unreliable in the world.<BR>

Absolutely recommend that you do not use this material until you have ample cannabis to counteract the salivation and possible nausea, and hopefully counter the sweating. A.M. + cannabis is a good pair, but not A.M. alone.
