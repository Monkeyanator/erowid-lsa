A few friends and I came across a large amount of Aminita's growing in a forest area while we were hunting for other mushrooms in a local field. We grabed as many as we could and dashed away, proud of our find. That evening we attended a small gathering at another friend's house. We boiled all of the mush. in a bit of water. We were left with a vile smelling tea which my friend and I (we were both already on good LSD) decided we couldn't possibly stomach. Two other friends dove right in. They mixed sugar with the brew and downed it all. Now bear in mind, my own state of mind was somewhat impared, but I do remember the evening being filled with extreme 'terror trips' from the tea drinkers. <BR>

We did have to talk sense back into them on numerous occasions, and this did nothing good for my own trip. They slept and were sick for the whole next day, saying they didn't remember anything, they compared it to being VERY drunk, and psycotic, with no control of their minds. I suppose that's what happens when your being poisioned. Please head this warning and steer clear of this toxic fungous.
