I recently took cocaine for the first time.  When I try a new drug, I usually try to keep a written log of what I'm doing and how I'm feeling so as to remember later how I felt when I used the substance.<BR>
<BR>
Here's the log I wrote while having my first and (probably last) cocaine buzz:<BR>

23h35<BR>
Nervous as Hell. I'm about to use coke for the first time.  It tastes bitter and numbs the tongue in a funny way.<BR>
<BR>
23h43<BR>
I'm REALLY nervous.  After all, this is COKE.  OK, I'll just do it now...  I did it... How much time will it take before it does anything?<BR>
<BR>
23h48<BR>
I'm not sure I feel anything.  Although I suspect something's just around the corner...  I feel the coke going down my throat.  It's rather unpleasant, just like when something you're drinking gets to your nose.<BR>
<BR>
23h53<BR>
I don't feel hungry anymore.  I'm gonna take a second line to see if anything happens then.<BR>
<BR>
23h57<BR>
I cut two other lines.  I'm taking them.  One's in.  In the right nostril, just like the first one.<BR>
<BR>
00h00<BR>
OK, the third one's in the left nostril.  At least half of it.  I finished the second half with my right nostril.  This smells/feels synthetic.<BR>
<BR>
00h03<BR>
OK, I think I'll just wait and see now.  All my palate and teeth feel numb.  Is this really coke?  I don't feel euphoria.<BR>
<BR>
00h07<BR>
I think I've been fucked.  Because I don't feel any euphoria and to tell the truth, I even feel a bit paranoid that I might have taken something bad for me.  My perception is slightly altered.  I wouldn't say it is hightened.  The pseudo-feeling I get somehow ressembles the one I'd get off of pot, only weaker.  I think I might have gotten PCP or some crap like that instead of coke.<BR>
<BR>
00h16<BR>
I don't know.  This doesn't seem really great.  I definitely have a ping, though.  I think my heartbeat's faster and that I'm affected in some way.  My mouth's gone from frighteningly numb to simply numb.  Should I take this experiment all the way and use a large quantity of coke?  The feeling of 'mental precipitation' somehow ressembles that of acid:  it seems to make you unfocused and prone to make more mistakes (typos for instance).<BR>
<BR>
00h35<BR>
I've been trying to find a chat room where I could ask people about coke for the past few minutes.<BR>
<BR>
01h09<BR>
I have found that cocaine is not for me.  I read some info on websites that says some people feel anxious and really don't enjoy coke.  I guess I'm one of them.
