I cannot understand what all the people who have sumbitted a report to this archive are going on about.  This might as well be an anti drugs site for the Gov. I and many, no, all of my friends consume cocaine occasionally.  Now just like Alchol you can get addicted, in fact its more likley with cocaine.  So if you are of an addictive personality*, feel like to the worlds against you, depressed, chronically unhappy, take asprin at the slight hint of a cold or *anything* and I mean *anything* similar then please please not touch the stuff as bad things really will happen to you. <BR>

It makes me feel great, I then feel really shit or worse.  But feeling bad is part of life and makes me feel more alive.  If you drink you expect a hangover, do you not?  I have felt like I am going to die after I've gotten really drunk.  So whats the difference? Smoke some weed and take some asprin, and you will feel a bit better. Put the wrap away and forget it until you really feel like is been a while.  3-4 Months at least.<BR>

This is easy for me, I am not everybody.  English degree educated and earn >$90k.<BR>

In 200 years all the people alive now will be dead.  That includes you and me.  Enjoy it while you can in all its forms. I do.<BR>
