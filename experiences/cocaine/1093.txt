I started out on pot when I was about 15. I was never one of those people to say, 'I'll never try anything else but pot.' I wanted to try other stuff before I started smokin' herb.<BR>
<BR>
I tried acid, E, hash and some other stuff, but never got hooked. I'm really good at quitting bad habits, even cigarettes, which were harder to quit than E. Anyway, it started when I was 16 years old. I was a virgin, and as any horny teenage guy, could not pass up an opportunity for sex. A girl I knew said she had some E, if I wanted to fuck while on it. I never had sex on E, actually I'd never had sex, so I said okay.<BR>

I went to her house, and of course, her being a cokehead, she changed her mind (or did she?). She said she would rather do it on coke. I really didn't want to do coke, but how could I resist? I wasn't one of those horny 16 year olds who would screw anything - this girl was really hot. So, we bought about $20 worth each, and snorted straight out of the bag. I was feeling great! Usually, I'm a pretty shy, mellow guy, but this stuff made me like an animal! I hit that coochie like a monkey on crack.<BR>
<BR>
After my first lay (which on coke lasted about 40 minutes), I started coming down. I figured, wow, I need a cigarette after this. But I didn't have any. So she asked wouldn't another bag be better than a pack of cigs? Sure, it would! I bought another sack, and we smoked a blunt, and later at night we got drunk and smoked another blunt.<BR>

The next morning I woke up with morning wood, and an unusual correlation between blueballs and a need to snort. But I was feeling too goddam sick to go and buy more coke, so I called her the next week, and went another round. The thing is, this time, when I snorted, the shit hurt my nose. I didn't think much of it, or the fact that the high was not as strong, but lasted longer, so I went along with it. The next day her friend told me it was E. Damn! I needed some coke. E is way too weak. A week later, I called again, but I remembered she went to Jersey. So, I looked around asking my weed dealers if they knew where I could get some coke. 'Man, we don't deal with that shit. Do we look like drug dealers to you?' True, I can't really say a weed dealer is anything like a drug dealer. Oh well.<BR>
<BR>
So, there I was, two weeks without coke. I called all week long even though I knew she wasn't home. I went to her house the next week, we got more coke and screwed again. The next day, I wanted more. But, I had to go with my parents to my brother-in-law's parents' house. Believe me, I was pissed. But after hearing their discussion about how their uncle OD'd on coke, I was touched. I vowed to quit. Although the next week I felt horny and called her, she said that her b/f was back, whom I didn't even know existed....<BR>
<BR>
Since then, I never snorted a line again. But I can't say I never think about it. And every time I have sex, I think how it is just okay, it would be a million times better on coke.
