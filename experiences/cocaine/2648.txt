Im not the pro-activist kind. Actually, for me to write this is kind of bizarre but I guess its just one way of letting it go and possibly getting some relief from my white 'friend'.<BR>

I can't consider myself a Junkie because I lead a normal life, I go to college, have a band, girlfriend, and all those funny little things that people fill their life with in order to be called normal. I have been a pothead since i was 13 and of course, this has never caused me any problems. Kind of premature, today I'm 20 and the only thing I haven't tried is heroin. I consider myself a real strong person, but believe me, when it comes to cocaine, it doesn't matter who the fuck I am. <!--Give the Dalai Lama a couple of lines and you'll see all his peace going straight to hell and the urge for more in his face.--><BR>

I decided to try it out of curiosity and today I'm in the USA for two months with my family in order to have time to think and get my head straight. I think I have repeated more than 25 times that I will never do it again, and here I am, without knowing if I'll find myself with my pupils the size of black holes whenever the next opportunity comes. In this long process of quitting I've had people snort in front of me more than 5 times and I've had the balls to say 'NO'. This has made me feel great as soon as I get home, with a happy face and with the possibility to sleep, but it also gives me a credit of 'I can control it!' that is as false as hell. <BR>

In my country cocaine is way too cheap... I can buy a whole gram for something like 2.50$. A quarter of a kilo for only 600$. I think that if a person likes this shit, they are fucked where I live.<BR>

This is a call to people who are thinking of trying it. If you wanna know and confront all the demons you have inside, try cocaine, but be prepared to face a real mental showdown. It will bring nothing positive out of you, and no experience will ever be like the first one. Have you ever found yourself in front of a mirror with your hands trembling to the point that you cant even get the key (or whatever) up your nose without dropping the stuff? Have you seen how fucking pathetic and sad you look? That is death in your eyes, of course, with a bloody disguise that gets by anybody on accounts of what we call 'A great feeling of euphoria and control!' Fuck you, cocaine is in total and slaving control, not you. Don't let this get to be a problem for you, cause you never know what card you are gonna get in this game. Remember, she always has the last word and the last laugh. Remember this the next time you are cursing yourself for not being able to sleep and for feeling like the lowest of the low. Free your mind and spirit, don't touch anything that will perturb your peace. If you are an addict, or you just like it, next time you have a chance to do it, wait a five minutes, think about it...think about what will come when you eventually go home, and if after that, you still wanna do it, go ahead, but take the fucking five minutes. You might thank me, and most important, thank yourself for not letting that shit decide for you.<BR>
<BR>
Peace.<BR>
