I tried cocaine at a party about 3 weeks ago. I was looking for 'X' (MDMA) but none was available so a friend offered to bump me up. I took two hits and nothing happened. I had the nasty drip, but all it did was irritate and speed me up. At least when I snorted 'X' I had more fun. So after I smoked a bit of the joint that was laced with it my friend offered to bump me up again. All it made want to do was go dance but in a bad way. With ecstasy I want to dance because it enhances the cool feelings that I am already having about the music and my surroundings, coke just was making me extremely annoyed. All in all, when I got home I just wanted to go to sleep, so I took care of that. I wouldn't ever try it again, and I don't see how anyone could spend their money on such a worthless drug. I'd rather have 'X' and weed at responsible intervals than deal with something that is that hit and miss. My friend had not tried it, but, she smoked off that joint and she was certainly enjoying herself, meanwhile I just wanted to leave. She also didn't wake up till 6pm the next afternoon. Odd.
