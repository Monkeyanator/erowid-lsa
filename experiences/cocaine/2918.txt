I really like coke.  More than any other drug I've tried, which include crystal meth, ketamine, dust and weed.  The first time I ever tried coke was at a party about two years ago with my friends.  Back then I don't think I realized how much I liked it because I was using so many other drugs.  Recently I started using coke again with a newer circle of friends. <BR>
It's hard to believe how addicting cocaine really is until you've run out of it and want more in the worst way.  After inhaling 3 $25 bags of coke, I find myself feinding for more, plotting ways to acquire more cash for it.  I can't explain the attraction, and sometimes I feel really guilty for liking it.  After all, I was a high honor roll student in college, have a good job, have nieces who look up to me.  <BR>

Coke is such an evil drug.  You can hear it calling you, luring you to buy more.  There's a constant picture in my mind of lines of coke on a CD cover ready to be snorted up through a $100 bill.  The feeling you get is amazing, and in such a short time.  It's like an immediate euphoria, you feel so much better after it's in your body.  No worries, nothing bothers you, you're just feeling like a million dollars.  Until you run out, and start to complain, get irritable.  <BR>

The day after you use is real hard.  I don't sleep well at all, then I'll just end up sleeping all day long until I wake up again around 7 or 8pm and desperately want some more.  I'm so tired when I don't have any.  I cry hysterically sometimes too, for no reason.  Coke is scary because it grips me so hard.  Just writing this is making me want some, but I know that it would be better to just catch up on some sleep.<BR>

If you're the type who gets addicted to things really fast, don't try this--you'll be an addict, and you'll be broke.
