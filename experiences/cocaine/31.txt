I started to snort cocaine about a year and a half ago it started with smoking pot and a friend of mine offered some coke to me and i agreed to take it.  After six months of it i realized that i was hooked on it so for the past year i have been quitting. just last week i threw away the last of my shit and it has been hell but i think that i can make it.  nobody really knows about it but a few close friends who have been very supportive of me quitting. i finally told my girlfriend about it and we agreed to break up till i got all the way clean. i hope and i pray that i can come clean and finish college and put it all behind me. if anyone reads this don't even start. it only takes one time and it ruins your life so bad it's not as good as it sounds and it's not cool you'll just end up hiding it from your friends and being ashamed of it
