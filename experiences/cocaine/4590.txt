The first time i did coke i was scared out of my mind. I'd heard so many bad stories that i thought anyone that did coke died on an instant. I was at a friends house and he pulled out this bag of white rocks, i asked him what it was and he simply replied in the most laid back voice 'coke', So me being up for anything i said ok even though in the back of my head i knew i shouldn't do it. <BR>

I was too scared to do the first line so he did it cut me a line gave me a straw and looked at me. I stuck the straw near my nose then almost up it and snorted it. I sat there and about 5min. later i felt this burst of energy i got wide eyed and he noticed me out of the corner of his eye bouncing on his bed. he looked at me smiled i smiled back and he cut 4 more lines for me. I did them all in a row it was THE BEST FEELING I'VE EVER FELT! <BR>

It's been about a year and a half now since my first line of coke and i've gotten in trouble by my mom about smoking pot and friends continually get on my back about drugs but the one thing that no one knows except for the people that are reading this now is that i haven't stopped. i mean i just recently started doing it alot more than i know i should but i can't help it. It's the best 'high' i've ever felt. It's not an obvious thing either i mean i weigh a little over what i should ok alot over what i should so no one expects it. They (meaning friends and family) have no clue and i intend on keeping it that way. It won't hurt anyone if no one finds out, right?
