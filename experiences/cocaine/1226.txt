It all started at the age of 15. Some friends of mine were looking for a new kind of high besides weed so we all decided to try some 'girl'. At first, we just bought a quarter $25 worth. My boyfriend laid out the lines and told us how to hold the straw so that we could sniff. <BR>

When my turn came I inhaled deeply and the coke shot straight to my brain. What a Feeling! The only bad thing was the thick drip that drizzled down my throat. After only a few moments I felt stronger than I ever had. I was so full of energy and life. I wanted more. My boyfriend bought $75 dollars worth and we all started to sniff some more. I never went to sleep and at that time I felt so alert and hyper. As the years went on my habit got up to $200 a day!<BR>

As good as this all sounds the effects after I came down were terrible. I was groggy and irritated. My stomach was so upset that I could barely hold anything down. Even worse when the habit becomes to much, I would start to steal. I would do anything to get my high. 6 years later and after 1 year of sobriety I still can smell the coke that once filled my body. I have stomach problems to this day and I still have the urge. So, think twice before you have to get higher!
