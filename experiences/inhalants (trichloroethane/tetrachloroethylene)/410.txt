<span class='erowid-warning'>[Erowid Note: 
Our understanding of the literature is that there is no such thing as safe recreational use of volatile solvents, aerosols and other street inhalants : their psychoactive effects are inseparable from nerve and organ damage. We have chosen to include these reports to help document the real world use of inhalants, but their inclusion is not intended to imply that they are anything but dangerous.]</span> <br>

Me and a few friends are big fans of trichloroethane, but it got banned as a cfc and powerful carcinogen. Now instead of 'try'cloroethane (which always had all the bells and whistles of tactile visual/mental/physical sensations) we have found a replacement.  Tetrachloroethylene, which has for me better bells and whistles than 1-1-1 trichloro.  <br>

Because I am well aware that it's a powerful carcinogen I take a few anti-oxident multivitamins as well as a few caps of Coenzyme-Q-10,which is also called ubiquinone; hopefully that will delay cancer, but anyone who huffs should look foreward to it sooner or later anyway. Great bells&whistles though-good luck.
