I must say that i have done just about everything until I did this.<BR>

When attending a party I had the chance to candy-flip...never did it before so WHY NOT? so 3-rolls and 8-drops later I was wondering why i passed it up so many times before until the 'K' came into the room. Me I like 'k', but in combo...not a good idea. My heart was pounding so hard it felt like it was outside of my chest.  The made me feel like I was ready to die I mean really die.  After that it was much a blur...but my b/f says I jumped up ran out the door took off and into the woods I went. <BR>

When they found me (hearsay) I was talking to someone but no-one was there but me.  They picked me up and carried me because I said I had no arms, legs or feet. I got back to the house I started to do the flop(this is when you have had just a bit too much k) hit my head off the keg stack, ran head first into the wall and then just sat stright down. <BR>

when I started coming to I was woundering why I was in so much pain telling me I begain to luagh.  If would have not done the 'k' I think Iwould have been fine but 'k' is coke U just don't pass it up when its free.  As they say the best drug is a free drug. But anyway the candy-flip was going great I would have to say the trip I have ever had. I have candy-flipped since then, but i leave the 'K' for its own trip!
