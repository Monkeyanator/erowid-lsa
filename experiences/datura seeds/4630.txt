I was in my third period study hall when the kid that sat in front of me told me that he had something for me to try.  he said it was 'Apple Thorns'  i had never heard of it before and he said that if i were to eat the seeds then i would feel like i was drunk.  so i took a handful of the seeds, fresh from the pod by the way, and ate them.  the taste was so bitter.  nothing happend for like 15 to 20 minutes and then i thought to myself 'dammit'.  but by the time i was in 4th period history, i started to feel the effects start to kick in.  i was really dizzy and i felt really good.  then they started to kick in harder.  i dropped my pencil and almost fell out of my chair.  the room was spinning around me.  i felt like shit.  i felt like i was going to throw up so i walked to the office and called home.  not knowing that there was physical signs of substance abuse.  i looked at myself later in the mirror and my eyes were bloodshot and dialated.  i could barely walk and my mouth was dry as hell.  <BR>

i started to walk to the bathroom cuz i was going to throw up.  as i was walking, i suddenly stopped, looked around, and i forgot where i was going.  then i remembered again so i continued on my way to the bathroom.  i got in the stall and started dry-heaving.  it was the worst experience in my life.  when my dad finally got to the school to take me home, it was 1:30.  i went home and slept.  and the whole time i had my eyes closed, i kept seeing bright white flashes of light.  and as i was laying in my bed, i started to hear voices and i didn't know where it was coming from.  i didn't even recognize the voices either but i started to talk back to them but they didnt' respond back.  then i fell asleep.  when i woke up, it was all over.  it was really strange.  i will never touch that shit again.
