Collected about 3-4 ounces of seeds one weekend. He was driving back with friend and took 2 teaspoonfuls of seeds. After about half an hour he still wasn't feeling affects so reached in the bag and grabbed a handful of seeds and started munching... friend was (hmm) flabbergasted.. this guy musn't have had any clue what it would do to him.<BR>
<BR>
Well, ten minutes later he's feeling the affects a bit.. just a bit of a buzz, and drops friend (stoned out of gourd) at his house and goes to park the car. Friend forgets about him for about an hour (go figure) and this is what happened:<BR>
<BR>
He drove off and doesn't know where he was heading, but ended up running his mom's brand new audi into a tree at some apartment complex. He was still functional enough to realize that he knew someone who lived in the area and went to her house... When she opened the door he was babbling about nothing at all and just running off at the mouth. Girl was a friend and loaded him into her car and took him to his house and dropped him off in the street. He walked inside his house (maybe 1.5-1.75 hours after eating) and goes into his room, gets his boombox and goes to the bathroom to take a shower. Strips down naked, gets in shower, no water.. gets out takes radio downstairs (still stark naked) and starts cleaning.. moving furniture and dusting etc... While his mom is sitting in the room trying to watch TV. She asks him what the hell he thinks he's doing... He replies, 'Goddammit Mom! Leave me alone, can't you see i'm trying to take a shower!! DAMN!' then starts babbling again...<BR>
<BR>
Well, his mom called for paramedics.. he was lucky.. pumped him full of some other drug, (thorazine maybe) fuzzy here.. and pumped his stomach. Doctors said he was very lucky.. maybe within an hour of death. Just thought i'd post this story.... kinda funny, but serious undertones... that shit messes with you. Set and setting aside, be prepared for a 'wild' time..
