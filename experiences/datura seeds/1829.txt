I believe I once took Datura. Only I knew it as malpitte, an afrikaans word which literally translated equals 'mad seeds'.<BR>
<BR>
I had seen the effects on one other person, so I thought I knew what I was letting my self in for. I don't know if I would recomend it to any one after having what was initially a bad trip. Unfortunately I cannot say how much I took, but it was about a matchbox full.<BR>
<BR>
It started affecting me about two hours later, when the sky and the sea turned from blue into green. I then started hearing voices and experiencing strange things. I have only limited memory of all that happend. But everything was cool, I mean I was acting really strange and all, until after I went to sleep - must have been 12-13 hours after I took the stuff.<BR>
<BR>
I woke up sometime in the middle of the night, and started having one the worst experiences of my life. Everything seemed so real. It was really bad. There were people all arround me, trying to get me, following me around with guns and knives, someone had planted a bomb right outside my tent, and I went looking for the cops so that they could come and diffuse it. I do not know how long I was running arround for in the state, but it must have been a good couple of hours.<BR>
<BR>
I finally made it back to the tent and fell asleep. After that night, I really believed all that I had hallucinated to be real. Reality was just a blur. I could not focus, and I was seeing double, but was wonderfully relaxed, just like being mildly stoned. This condition lasted a about two and half days, when I found that I could see in focus again.<BR>
<BR>
The feeling that I had for two days was wonderful, and I would like to have that again, but not if I have to suffer through another bad trip like that. Maybe I took too much, because a friend of mine took a bit less, and did not seem to have a bad trip.<BR>
<BR>
If you want to try the stuff, I say beware, and make sure you have a couple of days to recover.
