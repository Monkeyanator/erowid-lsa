Just a few days ago, I experienced my first flashback.  The drugs I have done are: Marijuana (all the time, from 2 hits to 1/2 oz), DXM (under 6 times, from 8 C&C pills to 32), Alcohol (under 10 times, only puking and passing out once), Datura (4 times, from tea and 1 to 3 pods worth of seeds eaten), Mescaline (once, 2 pellets), Mushrooms (30-40 times, from 1/16 oz to 1/4 oz of the STRONG stuff), and LSD (8 times, from 2-7 hits).<BR>
<BR>
The only bad trips I've had were from Datura.  I have had good trips from acid, shrooms, and mescaline, but get a little bit nervous from them, even a little bit on weed. <BR>

The experience:  It was a very cold day, and my friend dared me to go in the river near my house.  I got on my swimming suit and jumped in.  It was the coldest water I've felt in my life, and I could barely move.  I could barely stand the coldness, but went all the way under a few times.  After about 10 minutes of swimming, I looked up at the clouds, and they were swirling and shifting just like when I looked at them on acid.  No mindf***, but I got visual hallucinations (or should I say distortions, I consider hallucinations the stuff I see on Datura), a head/body high/euphoria, and mild audio distortions.  This lasted for only about 5 minutes.  My friend told me I looked like I was dead (my body was white/blue from the freezing water), and I wasn't even shivering (this water was under 40 degrees F).  I got out of the water, took a shower, got dressed, then went to my friend's house (3 houses away from mine, he went home when I took a shower).  We smoked 2 bowls, and the flashback came back for another minute (just the visuals this time, along with the usual marijuana high).<BR>
<BR>
Altogether, the flashback wasn't too intense (if I'd got it while driving it wouldn't impair me to the point where I'd crash or get pulled over), but it was pretty fun.  I may have gotten hypothermia, but I never went to the hospital or anything.  <BR>

I wouldn't recommend getting hypothermia or dehydrated (some of my friends do to get a 'high'), because even natural highs can be dangerous.-->
