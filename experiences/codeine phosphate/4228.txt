I am a fairly experienced drug user, hallucinogens, stimulants etc, but had never tried codeine until I managed to get 5 Tylenol 3's from someone's medicine cabinet. I downed them with four or five beers and felt NOTHING. There may have been a slight effect, but nothing that could be distinguished from the mild effects of the alcohol. (Although,I hurt my wrists a few months later and codeine seemed to help kill the pain. However, the injuries were pretty minor.) I also tried two vicodins recently, and the effect was noticable and pleasant but disappointingly mild. Maybe I have an abnormally high tolerance for opiates.
