I consumed the mushrooms with a few Ruffles to eliminate the taste of the fungi.  I tripped fairly well for a few hours and was on my way down from the peak of my trip. I have smoked salvia many times before this and decided I was ready to attempt it in combination with mushies.  So, on my way down already, I packed myself a bong hit of the five times salvia extract (probably about .15 grams).  I turned off the lights and music and lit a candle.  I puled the entire bowls worth of salvia in one bong hit and held it in my lungs as long as was possible.  <BR>

I laid down on my bed and closed my eyes... shit... It was one of the most incredible experiences I have ever had.  I could feel (and see) in my mind the salvia and the mushrooms fighting for superiority of my mind.  It was like two titans clashing with my mind as their coliseum.  I have experimnted with mixing drugs on many occasions and enjoy seeing which drugs will prevail.  It seemed to me before this point that psilocybin wa!<BR>
s a dominant drug...taking over alcohol and marijuana with ease..but the salvia kicked its ass.  After the initial mind/body waves that took me over, a flood of colors and sensory explosions bombarded me.  When the salvia seemed to be winding down, I sat up and opened my eyes.  Holy shit.  I was peaking again.  I tripped harder than i had during the peak of the mushrooms for another solid hour.  Mind blowing.  This, my friends, is how the salvia was meant to be smoked....
