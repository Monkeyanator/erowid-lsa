The one thing I learned from this experience, is less caffeine.  Also, I wouldn't want to use this drug/combination recreationally.  It could very well have its uses depending on the situation though.  Last minute studying, finals, or some other equally valuable use.  I would suggest for most people to use much less caffeine than I did.  The only reason I used so much is I am a heavy coffee drinker, and have a huge tolerance.
