well it my nite started out really exciting me and my friend were doing ectacy for the first time at my friends party. so we took the pills and waited after about an hour i was getting really frusterated because nothing was happening! we started to think we got ripped off....but the my friends pill started to really kick in. pretty soon he was having the time of his life going around hugging everybody and going on and on about how much fun he was having. <BR>

but the whole nite nothing happened for me! it really pissed me off. i just got really depressed and grumpy. the only reason i can think of that would make it not work is because i also take paxil, an anti-depressant, so maybe that had something to do with it.<BR>
