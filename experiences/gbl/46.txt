I had for the last two years a psychological addiction as well as a physical addiction to the substance known as GBL my brand was Renewtrient I loved that shit.  The problem was when I first started using it socially it was cool it took away all my worries and stress, then came the part were I needed it more and more to function daily to sleep properly my dosage sky rocketed through the roof. If this sounds familiar to anyone reading this and you found yourself out of control like I did or you still are and want to stop here are some great ideas that work and not just for me but about 15 other people I have already helped kick the habbit.<BR>

Monitor your intake for about 2-3 days find out exactly your intake per day, get ready for about 3 days of feeling some real fucking stress when you take your dosage and cut it in half and I mean in half.  For the next 2-3 days you will feel alot of anxiety but no where near the mental hell if you quit cold turkey, after these 3 days the anxiety, nervousness,and restlessness will end and from there only take the GBL to fight of the minor weird feelings that accompany any withdrawal symptom.
