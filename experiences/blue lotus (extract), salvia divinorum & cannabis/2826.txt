This was the most enlightening experience of my life. I had tried blue lotus on it's own the day before. It made me aware of my body's aura and of my friend's auras. We could all feel chi energy flowing between us. I felt fresh and natural. My body was buzzing with a gently fluffy energy. When we held our hands up to the sun we could feel it's energy flowing through us. We smelt all the flowers in my friend's garden. I felt that I was apprieciating beauty from beauty's point of view.<BR>

The next day was different. I had wanted to take lotus with salvia for a long time. I was sure that the combination of the two rare and ancient sacraments, one from the New World (Mexico), one from the Old World (Egypt), would teach me something very important. Traces of cocaine have been found in ancient Egyptian mummies. Cocaine comes from South America. There must have been a global sacrament using civilization in ancient times which traded across the Atlantic. Other evidence, such as the giant city found submerged off the coast of Japan; semi-submerged cities in Polynesia; ancient symbols found both on ancient buildings in Yemen and the Maldives; and a European line of Mitochondrial DNA found in Native American Indians, suggest that before the ice age and maybe for some time after there were intercontinental trade links. What did they trade? -The plants of the Gods.<BR>

Salvia Divinorum contains the most potent natural psychedelic known to man. The Aztecs called it Pipiltzintzintli which means 'powerful little prince'. The experience is unlike anything else. Time and space seem to break down into their constituent parts. Your consciousness is timeless and spaceless. And sometimes it makes you think you've turned into an inanimate object. <BR>

Blue lotus was worshiped by the ancient Egyptians. Other varieties of lotus were worshiped by the ancient Mayans, Hindus, Buddhists, Chinese and Japanese. The fossil record shows that lotus was abundent world wide before the ice age. In the ancient Greek epic poem 'the Odyssey', Odysseus and his men go to an island of Lotus eaters who are kind to them and give them lotus. The Lotus makes the men forget about home. Odysseus has to force them back onto the ship. Before I took the lotus I thought that this meant that lotus makes you forgetful. Now I know that it means home for Odysseus and his men wasn't a very nice place.<BR>

I smoked enough pot to make me a bit floaty, then I had some lotus extract. I smoked it until I started buzzing slightly. I could feel the energy flowing around me and through me. Then I said hellow to my good friend salvia, the divine diviner's sage. I didn't have very much salvia, it wasn't enough to make time stop. But when I stood up and walked around the garden the effect was incredible.<BR>
<BR>
I didn't feel like I was on any drugs. My head didn't feel cloudy from the pot and the salvia didn't make me confused. The lotus had stabilised them. I felt more natural, more aware, less confused than I have ever felt before. I wasn't having any distortions in my perception, no hallucinations. Everything was so crystal clear. I could see the patterns in everything. Every plant, insect and flower I could see how it was ordered. When I looked at some trees I could see every leaf on every tree at once, and I could see the pattern that they made. When I looked into the sky it didn't just look blue anymore, I could see an incredibly large space, like I was staring into infinity. The garden seemed enchanted. I could feel a magical force. I could feel the order inherent in reality, and the energy that drives it. I realised that there is no God, no nature, no man and no woman. There is only one thing. It is everything and nothing, it is infinitely big and infinitely small. It is rational and irrational, chaotic and ordered, certain and uncertain. It is perfection, but it couldn't be any other way. Even when it is imperfect, it is still perfect.<BR>
<BR>
I'm going to try taking a larger dose of both lotus and salvia next time. I feel that these two plants have already given me incredible insight into reality, and ancient civilisation. I suggest that if you want to try either salvia or lotus you take the other at the same time. They are two halves of a code. Salvia takes the world apart, lotus puts it back together again. If you believe that ancient sacred plants have something to teach us about ourselves and the world, take this sacrament. It is the most effective tool for understanding, and it's part of your heritage as a human being.
