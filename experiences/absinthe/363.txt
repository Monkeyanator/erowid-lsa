I made some Absinthe by simply adding ground wormwood to Pernod. I let it sit for a day before filtering out the mush and bottling the liquid. I had had Absinthe before but I couldnt stomache it so I thought a friend of mine should give it a try.<BR>

We were at another friends house when 'm' and I decided to bust out the juice. I shot down two glasses and he managed to get down four. About five minutes later I heard him call from the living room, 'Nate, I'm trippin' man'. He told me that the carpet had grown like a weed about 11 inches. He said that everything was swirling together and elongating. <BR>

The reason I dont know more than this is because he blacked out. He still cant remember anything now, a month later. He also got pretty ill the day afterwards so be carefull with this one.
