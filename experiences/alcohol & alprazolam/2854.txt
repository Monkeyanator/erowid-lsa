I was only 14 at the time of getting shitfaced.  Me and my dad usually go to my uncles trailer by the lake on weekends. He usually brings a cube of beer (24) there to unwind. One time he left early and left all the beer in the fridge.  I have gotten drunk a couple of times before and decided to go again.  I had 2 beers to start out in a huge plastic cup, its the best way to drink. I decide to take a quadbar 2 mg xanax to help me get drunk. Not a good idea.  I ended up getting a little daring and drank 4 more beers.  I don't remember much except for waking up, leaning over the bed and throwing up. I was to exhausted to clean it up so I put a thrashcan over the mess.  At around 10:00 my uncle woke me up to ask why I was passed out in the middle of the hall last night pissing on the floor.  I dont even remember that.  I hope this will tell you not to mix drugs!!!
