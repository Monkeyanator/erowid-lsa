<!--reported use of mescaline, which i doubt is mescaline. have read another report of insufflating 'mescaline'. keeping this on that acct--><BR>
<BR>
A very casual drug user, I started doing test runs with my first drug, which was Marijuana. That was a few weeks after my 15th birthday, and since it was around a gram and a half with hits on a bong and the rest in joints, I got a very potent high that I hadn't experienced before. I continued smoking on a monthly basis, perhaps four or five times a month, and later on in the year it became whenever a friend had any weed on them. Around half a year later I was downtown looking for something to abuse, when a dealer there asked me if i'd rather try some Mesc. 'Mescaline' (at least the one I purchased then and later on) was a white powder that was insufflated much like Cocaine, but had a less strong dishwashing liquid scent in comparison. I'd never tried it, so I went home and cut a few lines of the gram, which for 15 dollars was quite a deal.<BR>
<BR>
After snorting some three 2-3 inch lines and about .5 centimetres thick, I got a buzz less than two minutes later. It was a buzz which I thoroughly enjoyed, not unlike pot but different. For one, it lasted at least four hours therein, and the effect could resurface a day later if I smoked a cigarette for example. It was a buzz which cancelled out my problems or thoughts, it made me numb. Numb like a stone, and it gave me a very drowsy heavy headed composure. It remains my favourite drug, but due to the cold weather most dealer's remain at their home in the winter and i'm not close to any enough to get their addresses. This is why summer is my favourite season :]<BR>
<BR>
Returning to my original subject, during the period I was doing mesc, I also purchased cocaine at least four or five times. The reason for such few purchases is the expensive price - 20 dollars for 250mg or a quarter, and the fact that it is sent in as kilo bricks in large crates, kind of ridicules the idea of selling a pinch of it for a 20 bill. Anyhow, whenever I did cocaine I got the familiar rush of a racing heart and a difficulty swallowing, well not a difficulty but swallowing was considerably harder due to the powder going down (it goes much thicker and slower than mescaline). <BR>
<BR>
One day I went downtown again and decided to try something new, I still have not tried crystal meth or ice (its smokeable form), or crack cocaine, but that day I managed to obtain some heroin. The heroin I bought came at a size of 500mg, and cost less in comparison with cocaine, so I was hoping I'd found something new to enjoy on a casual basis. In reality, I never did cocaine or any other drug (with the exception of mescaline for a brief period) more than twice a month, I avoided addiction with straight morals and knew that a tolerance could build, and do this day I can get wasted off half a quarter of coke, half a gram of weed, and a quarter of mescaline. This is why it was exceptional for me to combine two drugs at once, I had only used marijuana in conjunction with mescaline up to now. I had heard of speedballing, which involves shooting cocaine and heroin, or at least shooting the heroin and possibly snorting the coke, so I looked over the guidelines one of my friends showed me on how to shoot properly, it was my first time.<BR>
<BR>
I had obtained the syringe from the office of one of my father's friends who is a doctor, and so after the usual procedures, I boiled the spoon and prepared to shoot. In all honesty, I was so high within seconds of shooting that it seemed the cocaine did not matter. However, I struggled to bend forwards slightly and snort three lines, which was a tall order with this great buzz I know had. Within the next ten minutes, my heart was beating and I was half alert, but then I was engulfed with a pleasant warmth I only got perhaps when consuming alot of brandy, whisky or any strong spirit. It was positively the best buzz I had every imagined, and I didn't want it to end no matter what. And it didn't. At least for the next hour I felt I was walking on clouds.<BR>
<BR>
Since then, three months now, I have done cocaine once and smoked weed perhaps a few times a month at most, and it was usually a friend's stuff. I dont buy anymore, since the money simply isn't worth throwing on drugs, but I do enjoy feeling numb from time to time, it seems it just doesn't happen enough. Perhaps that's a hidden blessing.
