<!--combined Meth with opioids, reported stabilizing effect on heart rate--><BR>
<BR>
Background Info:<BR>
<BR>
Two days earlier I had gotten a dental operation, so I had some hydrocodone and percodan, both opiate-based pain killers, percodan being a good deal stronger than the codone. I have used crystal meth on and off for about four months, with about a two month break in the middle. My preferred method of using meth is smoking it, since smoking it produces more euphoric effects than snorting.<BR>
<BR>
I know the guy who makes the meth, so I know it's fairly high quality (85% pure, to be exact). It comes in soft, crystal shards that grind into a fine powder. The cost (direct) is $90/8-ball. <BR>

The Session:<BR>
<BR>
I started out at around 10:00 PM, and started smoking bumps. From 10:00 until two friends came over at 10:30, I smoked about .2 grams. At that point I was feeling mildly spun(term used to denote state on crystal meth), and realized it was time to take my pain killers. I downed 2 hydrocodone pills, and 1 percodan. Me and my friends smoked about .5 grams more from 10:30 untill 11:45--it was around 11:30 that I felt the pain killers kick in. I had the base feeling of being spun; I was sped up, very talkative, and mildly euphoric. The pain killers, I noticed, kept my heart at a fairly normal beat, and enabled me to close my eyes and almost go to sleep. I also felt less of the feeling that I had to do more meth, which is always present when I do it.<BR>
<BR>
I would sum up that pain killers simply counter the effects of meth, which is very nice, since I noticed that I could sleep on meth if I took a few pain killers.<BR>

That's all...everyone remember, be safe, and have a merry Christmas!
