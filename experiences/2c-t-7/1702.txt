Carefully weighing out 120+-mg of pharmaceutical 2C-T-7, I added the crystals to 30 ml of dH2O resulting in a solution of approximately 4mg/ml.<BR>
<BR>
4:00PM Off work, I take an 10cc oral dose syringe out (same one used to measure the water) and draw exactly 1cc (4 mg) of this solution and squirt unceremoniously into my mouth.<BR>
<BR>
4:30 waiting<BR>
<BR>
5:00 waiting<BR>
<BR>
5:30 a slight alert, only barely noticeable<BR>
<BR>
5:45 some mood elevation, slight nausea<BR>
<BR>
6:00 now I am feeling the substance. It has a warm very rosy feel to it, even though it was preceded by uneasy stomach.<BR>
<BR>
8:00 Ok, I know some will say it ain't so, but my curtains are revolving tubes of vertical colors. It isn't a huge visual, and it takes some staring, but it is there. This substance gives a secure and warm feeling. In a dose of 2mg it might be an excellent antidepressant. The edge of psychedelia is there even at 4mg, although I have heard it isn't active below 10mg.<BR>
<BR>
10:00 Down completely, weird background echos, but otherwise normal.<BR>
<BR>
excellent material. I recommend experimentation in both higher and lower dosages, perhaps as low as 1mg. Certainly I went over threshold at 4mg.
