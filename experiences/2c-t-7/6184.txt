This is really a corrollary to Jetsam's 2C-T-7 report (see <a href='/experiences/exp.php3?ID=6127'>Malleable Hallucinations</a>), an experience for which I served as a sitter. I'm writing it because I observed very carefully her physiological response during the first 30 to 40 minutes and noted what I believe to be predictable patterns, for the same timing has held for myself and others I've witnessed.
<br>

<br>
I weighed out 7mg of powder for Jetsam which she split between both nostrils. The burn hit her hard. Following is a minute-by-minute account of my observations of her condition:
<br>

<br>
At 3 minutes she was flushed, perspiring, and her eyes were well dilated. It was obviously quite an intense coming up.
<br>

<br>
At 5 minutes she began having muscle tremors. She seemed to plateau at this point for a minute or two.
<br>

<br>
At 8 minutes she began showing signs of real discomfort. She curled up into a ball and asked that I hold her hand. I took her pulse; it was faint and accellerated.
<br>

<br>
Between the 9th and 10th minute was her first indication of any nausea. She asked for water. I began to get a little concerned, for Jetsam is a highly experienced psychonaut who's handled a *lot* of hairy situations and here she was having what appeared to be a particularly difficult time of it. I was extremely relieved having done nothing myself so that I could monitor her progress.
<br>

<br>
By the 11 minute point, she was visibly wincing and having muscle contractions, predominantly in her legs (from outward appearances).
<br>

<br>
By 15 minutes, she was full bore into the experience and was clearly having difficulty assessing her situation. I helped her into the bathroom after she indicated she was feeling the need to vomit.
<br>

<br>
At 18 minutes she had a massive purge. I've seen Jetsam vomit plenty, but this was more than I'd ever seen her expel. The duration of each expulsion worried me -- fluid would flow for 1-3 seconds. I immediately recognized the serious possibility of asphyxiation from such prolific puke. <span class="erowid-caution">This is a real danger which should be anticipated by anyone insufflating this substance. Have a sitter with you when you snort this stuff!! And especially right there with you if you have to throw up.</span>
<br>

<br>
By 25 minutes, things were settling in. Once things leveled out, we had a great time. You can read her report for the rest of the story.
