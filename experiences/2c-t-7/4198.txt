I tried to smoke the HCL form out of a bowl sprinkled over some marijuana but it wasn't any good.  This time I decided I would vaporize the freebase form.  I measured out 10mg of the HCL and put it in my vaporizer.  Now I dropped a drop of ammonia over it and set it aside to evaporate.  After it was all gone I turned on the torch and got ready to smoke.  I allowed it to fill up as much as possible with the vapor then quickly inhaled.  I hadn't even inhaled half of it and I was forced to blow it all out.  It was the same terrible burning it gave me when I snorted it but this time I couldn't use the Lidocaine.<BR>

It keeped getting worse for the next five minutes or so.  It hurt quite a bit to breath.  This defenately wasn't good.  Eventually, after about 30 minutes I started to feel a little better.  The pain went away and I noticed I was tripping a bit.  It was a very mild trip with little visuals.  It actually felt pretty good but this seems like a a sure way to die.  I strongly discourage everyone from using this route of ingestion. <BR>
