Snorted 7mg of a white powder last night, believed it to be either MDMA or 2CB. The vial was unlabelled but Flotsam and I knew the unlabelled white powders in our possession were MDMA, 2CB, or 2C-T-7. I went first, and it was a good thing Flotsam waited to see what effects I was having, as there was nobody else around to babysit us.  We'd started the evening playing around with our new bodypaints, painting a bird-like mask on my face. The plan was to take pictures under blacklight, both of us using the unlabelled white powders about halfway through to enhance an evening of making art and trippy photographs. <BR>

Within minutes of insufflation, my respiration and heartrate was increasing rapidly and my vision was blurring. I lay back in my favorite chair, just trying to concentrate on my breathing. Flotsam came out to see what was up with me. I don't remember clearly what happened next. He asked me what I thought it was; I said it wasn't MDMA. I remember feeling a lot of anxiety about my physical reaction, the racing heartbeat and breathing, my hot and clammy skin. The visuals were getting more intense, somewhat like dmt visuals, but they made me feel nauseous. I wavered in this half ecstatic, half painful state, feeling myself being pulled into a very strong experience, much like dmt, and resisting it. I couldn't stand to have my eyes open but the visuals were SO compelling. I would open them, then close them, but starting to become unable to tell whether they were open or not. My resistance added to my anxiety. I asked Flotsam to just sit and hold my hand while I fought the panic and nausea. I writhed in this state for some minutes I think, then decided I should be in the bathroom as the nausea was getting worse.<BR>
<BR>
I think I walked to the bathroom. I remember sitting on the edge of the bathtub, swaying back and forth with my eyes closed. I found I could make the visuals happen, will them into being, make them crescendo with the music or fade away. I spent what seemed like a very long time laughing and playing with this. (It was more like 5 minutes.) The nausea subsided while I was focused on my visuals so I went back to my chair and played some more like this. By far, this was the highlight of the entire experience, being able to willfully create the most intense, roiling visions behind closed eyes! <BR>
<BR>
At some point the nausea returned and I realized I would have to get the purge over with to enjoy the rest of the show. I made it so. That over, I settled back on the floor and just rocked and rolled with the waves. (Nausea did not return the rest of the night.) Leg tremors started in the inner thighs, gentle orgasmic spasms, leading to a very sensual place for me and Flotsam. I have no idea how long this went on (a long time!!) but it was extremely enjoyable and the visuals played right along with me.<BR>
<BR>
These were the highlights for me. It tapered off after that, though the visuals were good and strong for what seemed like several hours (only about three in reality). So there was good time distortion with it too. I was euphoric, still hallucinating wildly, but able to follow directions to complete the planned art project. The visuals hung on almost TOO long, I was ready to go to bed, my body was whipped, felt like my cage had been severely rattled (just like on 2CE), but I couldn't stop my eyes from registering these neon chasing lights and moving patterns. I eventually fell asleep, in spite of the mild leg spasms, about 6 hours after snorting it. Severely tired the next day, and out of it.<BR>

I learned you should have a baseline sitter with you if you snort this stuff. The visuals and the time distortion were so strong I was not aware of my surroundings for quite awhile.
