I cannot stress enough the importance of a safe setting for this drug for the first time user.  Having a partner or babysitter in this experience is highly recommended as well as there will most probably be moments of extreme confusion or complete unawareness of your own actions & surroundings.<BR>

Start with a small dose <10mg.  If there's one thing hindsight has taught me, it's to measure my drugs.  More does not equal better.  You're kidding yourself if you think big instant gratification is better than a slow & steady build up in this ride.<BR>
<BR>
Be prepared to vomit... repeatedly.  Especially if ingested through insufflation.  The burn is intensely painful, streaming tears, and the drip gagging to the point of distraction.  Nausea tends to linger.<BR>

The onset was in a public setting (first mistake) at midnight (second mistake).  I lost my cohort for a while & have never felt more alone, scared, or CONSPICUOUS in my life.  Time has never gone so slow.  What seemed like at least 3 hours was barely 1/2 an hour.  It was a struggle to get to a home base.  All motor functions were effected and confusion prevailed.<BR>
<BR>
It was my first experience & completely overwhelming, an absolute loss of control.  Hallucinations were extreme to the point where all I wanted was to sit in a dark room with my eyes closed.  There were lucid moments where reality would slam back in, quickly followed by thoughts that I needed talking down or I'd be permanently lost in this fearfully dark place.<BR>
<BR>
A safe setting changed everything, though I was still avoiding *looking* at anything for several hours.  Any kind of direct artificial light was too harsh for me to bear.  Several hours into the trip I was able to finally enjoy some of what was going on around me, however, wracking spasms & severe body tension persisted throughout the night.  <BR>
<BR>
Sleep evaded me for the most part, except for moments where I'd slip into horribly disturbing dreams.  <BR>

I can see the potential in this drug in smaller doses and intend to give it another go.  There was a sensual side that warrants further exploration, along with reflective visuals that would be better experienced during the day.  I would avoid another evening trip until I'm better aquainted with the effects.
