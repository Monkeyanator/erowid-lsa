This is just more of a general look out....<BR>
<BR>
Ive done 2C-T-7 on several occasssions, by itself, with ecstacy and with acid.<BR>
<BR>
Ok, this drug is really fun and i actually cannot believe that im saying this, but if youre going to do it(which i DO NOT recommend)...be careful<BR>
<BR>
First, off....i've dont this about a dozen times or so...each time i've had a blast, seen new things(especially on acid and 2ct7)...but this drug seems to have done sometime to my vison as well as my friends vison.  well, when me and my friends are tired, drinking, or on other drugs....the visuals from the 2ct7 come back.  the visuals are a lot less noticeable, but you can just see patterns in things, like the carpet, air, everything.  now, it has been about 2mos since ive done the drug and my vision is still being effected to this day.  another thing....whenever my friends and i have done this drug, in the past, it has messed up our sleeping patterns for several weeks.  typically, after doing this drug, my friends and i dont sleep much, if at all for about 2-3wks.  when we do sleep, its usually only for 2 or 3 hours and then we are awake for several days.<BR>
<BR>
im just putting this out there as something to consider before doing this drug.  mainly because this is a relatively new drug and there isnt much known about the drug and its side effects.  if you do this drug, have a blast with it...i know you will, but please think about possible future side effect of this.
