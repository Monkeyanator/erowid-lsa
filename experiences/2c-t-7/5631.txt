This substance is one all parties need to respect regardless of past experience, age, or wisdom.  Last weekend I decided to take 2-ct-7 for the second time hoping for a more prominent response.  I recieved it in a powder form, supposedly weighed out to two doses about 20mgs a piece.  The first time I attempted taking this drug I took the cautious aproach, ingesting a very small amount of the 'blue mystic' powder.  I was disappointed receiving little more then trails and dialated pupils. There were no real visuals, and I was more clear thinking then ever.<BR>
     <BR>
This weekend I got a bit more cocky and paid heavily for it.  An hour after ingesting a moderate portion of my bag I began to feel a relatively intense speedy roll, normally associated with mdma.  I unfortunately don't care for this effect, making it more unpleasant.  Soon came visuals of intense proportions, nothing like I have ever experienced even on 500-600mcgs of LSD.<BR>

This lasted almost 12 hours.  The craziest aspect was the flashing lights and 'black hole' light effects 2-ct-7 produces.  As I walked down my hall to the bathroom it was as if the hallway had been cut into thirds moving asymetrically towards the apparent vanishing point at its end.<BR>
     <BR>
I laughed at its power, but more in shear amazement then in enjoyment. A word to the wise: 2-ct-7 is a powerful psychedelic and can surely be utilized responsibly.  However, it is not a drug for any newbie to psychedelics, and it can test the wits of even the most experienced psychonauts.  <BR>

Please be responsible for this crushed me like no other psychedelic I have ever taken.  This warning comes from an individual who has been paid to sit over insane LSD and mushroom trips. 2-ct-7 can be enjoyed assuredly, but responisbility, support, and research should be undertaken before jumping into the colorful cavern it creates.<BR>
