My first 2C-T-7 experience came true one night at a party. It had been a quite nice Saturday evening and I was heading to one party held in the local Cable Factory.<BR>
<BR>
I went there alone and I was having good time. After a while, I saw a friend of mine. He had ordered 2C-T-7 from the states and was willing to sell me some. Of course, he did rip me off. He asked 100 marks (about $17) for 20 mg capsule. I bought one and swallowed it with a sip of water. I had taken some vitamins earlier at home before I left for the party, just to play safe.<BR>
<BR>
After an hour or so I started to see blurry. All the sudden, I didn't feel anything before it. After few minutes everything turned upside-down. I didn't see anything quite so blurry anymore. Everything I saw was sharp but filled with visual 'noise', little dots of red, green, blue and yellow. At that point, I wasn't feeling so sharp mentally anymore. I felt like I was drunk, which I hate so much. But I got thru it.<BR>
<BR>
The same thing went on for few hours. At 4 a.m. the party was in it's end. I left towards my home, walking and alone. While walking in the empty roads of Helsinki, I felt myself so fragile in some way. I also had some symptoms which can be related to delirium tremens. I was feeling just a bit paranoid. After I got home. I went to shower and after that I went straight to the bed.<BR>

I didn't sleep so well. I woke up some hours later feeling a bit lightheaded. The whole experience wasn't so great. I didn't like the feeling of being drunk and seeing hallucinations. Comparing to other hallucinogens I must say, that 2C-T-7 gave a big visual adventure, but left me feeling lonely and fragile.
