I'm going to leave out the timeline on this report because it really doesn't matter.  Set and setting seemed to have very little influence on the effects of this drug, except during the initial coming up period, but even this part was completely managable.  Visuals were very powerful, but 95% were just swirling fractals and long tracers.  Imagine this would be better at an increased dosage.  On the mental end, there was a potential for insight and healing usage but it was very limited in that absolutely any distraction was amplified a thousandfold and made it impossible to concentrate at the mental task at hand.  Not party material simply because loud groups would have been out of the question, but there were no problems socializing with a group of friends other than a slight lack of desire to say anything...<BR>

Will try again at a slightly higher dose and see if there is any more benefit...  The material was from Jay Lawrence Farm BTW, and I have heard from others that this is less potent in some way...  it sure isn't lasting my rats very long, they need much higher doses than expected to achieve the desired results.<BR>

Well, that's about it for this report.  Not a disappointment by any means, but it did not live up to what was said in many other reports about the visuals.
