I injected 6mg of 2ct7 prepared as a 20mg/mL solution in saline. Within 10 seconds of injection, I felt a flushing throughout my body and everything seemed to wobble. In about 30 seconds, I felt nausea start to come on, so I went to the bathroom in case I vomited. The nausea became SEVERE, worse than I have ever experienced from 2CT7. I vomited about 10 times. Then, feeling somewhat better, I went and got a glass of water. After drinking the water, I became extremely nauseous again and vomited the water. The trip lasted about three hours, with nausea pervading the entire experience, even outlasting the visuals. I cannot really describe the effects accurately since I had taken it the day before, but it was equal to a 12mg nasal dose, which is equal to about a 30mg oral dose for me. I doubt I would repeat it.
