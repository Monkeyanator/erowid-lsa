It was January 2nd 2000, so we were all a little down after the festivities of millenium night. Our friends Jo and Jon had returned to university halls, and we decided to go and spend the evening with them and take some pills.<BR>
<BR>
After an hour or so at the local pub, we went back to Jon's house, and got busy with the pills. I have been taking pills for about a month now, and have found that the effects have been changing in recent sessions. Although the feeling of wellbeing is still there, the euphoric rushes are missing. As a result of this, my friend Sam and I decided to do our first ever 'Double drop'. So out came the water and we both swallowed two Double Euro's, which are our pill of choice over here.<BR>
<BR>
I sat down and built a spliff while we waited. It usually takes me about 1Hr to properly come up, so I was ready for the wait.<BR>
<BR>
Within 30 mins, however, the effects were in full force. Euphria was present, and it was just like the first time again.<BR>
<BR>
Soon after, another friend arrived, with a small bag of dried mushrooms. So, out came the saucepan, and we boiled up some tea.<BR>
<BR>
After about 2 cups of mushroom tea, I could feel the tea start to work, my good feeling from the pills was still there, but it had been sort of 'softened around the edges'.<BR>
<BR>
I decided that this was not really where I wanted to be, so I took another tablet, again a 'Double Euro', and waited.<BR>
<BR>
The rush came at about T+3.5 hours, but was not quite as good as the first time, so I took another 1/2 tablet.<BR>
<BR>
Throughout this I continued to drink cups of mushroom tea, and after we had boiled them about 5-6 times, we then cooked them 1 last time, and put them into some soup, which we all consumed.<BR>
<BR>
When I normally consume pills, I usuallly drop at about 8pm, and end up crashing out at about 4am. When I combined my pills with mushrooms, I managed to keep going until 7am, and even then I did not feel as exhausted as I usuallly do.<BR>
<BR>
In conclusion - is the combination a good one?<BR>
<BR>
I think not. I was enjoying my experience a lot more before the shrooms kicked in, and felt that they toook the edge off of my high.<BR>
<BR>
However, nearly all of my friends who were present that night disagree with me. They all ended up in fits of giggles, and one reported full-on visual tripping.<BR>
<BR>
I would say try it, it doesn't seem to do any harm. But I personally am not going to try it again.
