i first started taking Adderall just cuz i wanted to get messed up. i was smoking pot about everyday then and it wasnt all that fun anymore. we had christmas break and my brother and a friend of mine was perscribed to adderall. i started to take it from my brother then bought it from my friend.my brother started to tell on my for taking his so i had to buy it from a friend of mine. i stole all my christmas presents for people so that i could buy the stuff. my parents r never home so they didnt even notice. school started again and i started taking it more and more. i couldnt go a day without it. i lost weight which was wonderful and i was finally paying attention in school and coming up with new ideas and doing well with my art. i loved it. soon 20 mg werent doing the job as well as it used to. i started talking more and then snorting ritalin later in the day when it was wearing off. i would lock myself in my room until about 1 am just drawing and cleaning and painting. i loved it. soon i started to get scared. when i would go to bed my heart would be beating so fast like if it was coming out of my chest. i blacked out twice and started to get really bitchy. i new i had to stop cuz it was messing up my organs and brain. i slowly just stopped by taking about 1 a week. now im completely off of it. i just stopped doing all drugs all together and i love it. its so refreshing. i can finally think for myself instead of a pill doing it for me. i have so much more energy now and im not all bitchy. it was hard for me to quit but i did and im happy now. its the best thing for me but i would have to say i dont regret doing it. i advise people not to go crazy over it. its a very strong drug and is very dangerous to your body. its very very addictive.
