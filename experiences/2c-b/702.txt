I had some 2c-b from a friend, who told me, it's a good dosage, whatever this means!? (I guess it was around 20mg). I had read before a bit, and thought it would be like X, with a bit of LSD effects. It was the other way around. It hit me about an hour after I took it. We where at a Psy-Party, which I like very much, but not this time, even if it was the best party since a while, nice sound and nice people. I just felt uncomfortable around all these people, and the sound swirling around and all the psychedelic decorations. Outdoor-Party would have been much better! But anyway, I tried to enjoy the trip, so I went outside. Unfortunately, it was cold, so I went to the car. I reached the peak about T+1.5h. Now, a little storm had started, and the rain and the wind were my music, and every raindrop made wonderful patterns on the front window. For a while, I thought I would have to throw up, but I  didn't, and it went by. In all, it was a good experience, but for me, a bit less would have been better.
