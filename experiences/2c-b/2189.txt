I am finding that 2C-B is generally quite 'shallow' as far as psychedelics go. At doses under 30mg it's great fun, and cool for dancing, listening to music, etc. It can sometimes get a bit daunting, when you start to feel really fucked. I don't know about doses above 30mg.<BR>

I have also noticed that it's a really weird drug, in that it behaves almost totally differently depending on what you are doing. If you sit around, you start to feel *really* relaxed, placid, and almost like you want to fall asleep. You feel like you are floating in the clouds, and the last thing you want to do is get up. Then, if you do get up and do something, it suddenly clears, like the clouds have evaporated, and you are left with an amazingly clear and sharp psychedelic awareness. You start to slip into the clouds again if you relax or stop moving around. But modes both are pretty cool.<BR>

I do find though that I generally don't think much on 2C-B, and there are few psychedelic type life-changing revalations. Most of the time I don't think at all, and my only thoughts are really just emotions, like primal feelings. You 'feel', instead of think, IMHO. There are also no recursive thoughts like with LSD, and almost no paranoia, etc, so maybe it's a two way street. I usually feel pretty good on 2C-B, once I get into it.
