Hey all,<BR>
<BR>
I had my first really positive experience with 2cb recently, at 18mg (I think this was my 6th trial of 2cb).  It was mildly disorienting and body-painful as it came on (first 1+hr), but settled into an interesting experience.  This is described elsewhere.<BR>
<BR>
I had a single mildly positive experience with 7.5mg 2cb and rue, but 2 were _negative_, bad body feel, headaches, low BP, and 2 were not positive at all.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
My understanding of 2cb now:<BR>
<BR>
1) Its effects can be subtle and vary significantly with trial (based on my and several other VPL'ers experiences).  I've had the opportunity so far to only work with drit's tablets.<BR>
<BR>
2) It seems to reduce my blood pressure to the point of getting motion-based headaches, as it comes on, as I come down, and for the next 24 hours.  There have been two papers which have shown 2cb's bp dropping effects (I was told this after my last experience because I was talking about the bp lowering effects)... (Refs given at bottom)<BR>
<BR>
3) For me and a couple people I've talked to, the initial stages of 2cb are quite hard and I realized on my last trial that I really needed to try to relax into the experience and let the body and mind hard stuff go by... headaches and other body discomforts are common.<BR>
<BR>
4) There might even be a 'learning curve' with 2cb for some people. I'll have a better idea about this when I try it again (prolly not too soon).  Another VPL'er has said that he needed several attempts before he was able to get through to something good.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
On a personal note, my body has low BP normally.  If 2cb lowers BP, I may be more prone to the negative effects of this than others.  Is it possible that the rue + 2cb would increase BP to compensate for 2cb's action of relaxing the valves? For me, the next 24 hours after 2cb, I experience motion-sensitive headaches and get dizzy and vision-fadey when I stand up quickly.  I associate this with low BP.<BR>
<BR>
I am considering trying some BP increasing herbs with 2cb next time.. ?<BR>

I apologize that I haven't read this, but was told by a reliable VPL'er that it discussed a relaxation in the aortic system.. and a drop in BP.<BR>
