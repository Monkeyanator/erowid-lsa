The pictures on the wall became 3-D and the air looked like fog. In contrast my mind was completely clear. The only time I have ever had visuals like this I was on something upwards of twenty hits of good acid. The difference was that on acid I couldn't think while the visuals were that intense whereas on bromo I could actually do o-chem. I have done it twice. Once at 20mg and once at 40mg. The pain of snorting 40mg didn't justify the increased visuals but at 20mg it was definately worth it. If you have any more questions, just e-mail me. If you post there is a good chance that I won't catch it since I don't have time to keep up with the newsgroups.
