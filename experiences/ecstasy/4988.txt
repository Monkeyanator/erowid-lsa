The last time I rolled,I took two and a half pills. The preparations we took were buying cigarettes, which calm one's stomach if it is upset while rolling, popsicles, which taste and feel really cool when rolling, and MiniThins, which bring your roll back when you start to come down. The pills we took were white Pikachus.  They were taken at approximately 2:30a.m. The roll lasted until approximately 9 a.m. The setting was a hotel room and the mindset was positive, very happy.<BR>

I found that the larger the dose I take, the worse I feel the next day.  I have also found that if I take a large quantity one night, I have a really bad roll the next.  I have found that ecstasy affects my period.  I am on birth control, Depo-Provera, which eliminates my period altogether but I have found that about a week after I rolled, I bleed for a few days.  Also, before I was put on Depo-Provera, my periods were longer and much heavier because of the e.  I know for a fact that this is from the use of estacy because I consulted my doctor about the matter. [erowid note: It is unlikely that doctors would know anything about this.]  I have also talked to other females who have experienced the same problems.  I have also found that the day after, I find myself crying uncontrollably for no reason.  But what helps me not feel as bad the next day is if I take the herbal supplement, rosehip.
