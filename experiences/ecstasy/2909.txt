The third time I tried XTC, I did it at my home with 4 other friends. The previous times I had done it with only my boyfriend. I planned on having a 'rolling party' while my parents were out of town. I took my pill when my boyfriend did, before my friends got there. When I was in my garage smoking a cigarette I suddenly vomited blue kool-aid all over the floor! I had never vomited from XTC before. However, this did not make the experience any less pleasent, I would say it made it even better! With vomit all over my face and clothes I looked horrible but felt wonderful. I walked up the stairs to the shower and I felt like I was walking throught Jell-O. The shower afterward was the most amazing thing I have ever experienced in my life. It felt like I was being enveloped in a warm soothing liquid blanket that made me feel safe. I returned to my friends who were now rolling in the garage. One was dancing to Lords of Acid and feeling her body all over. One was sucking on a pacifier. One was smoking weed, and one was just sitting there petting my cat.<BR>

I felt strangely physically attracted to my best friend of ten years. I asked her if I could suck on her nipples because I had the urge to. All of this seemed very confusing yet enlightening to me. I was sexually attracted to my best friend and I had never been before and probably never will again. My boyfriend and I were sharing with each other how much we loved each other and even considered getting married! *something that we would never have done sober* <BR>
         <BR>
Eventually the peak of my XTC wore off and I was suddenly annoyed with having all these people in MY house.  They suddenly became annoying little flies that had to be shooed away. So I kicked them all out except for my boyfriend. After they all left, excluding my boyfriend, I felt much better and was even beginging to feel euphoric again. He and I engaged in oral, vaginal, and anal sex for about four to five hours, something never done before.<BR>

Then I eventually drifted into a deep sleep and did not wake up for another twelve hours. I felt groggy, irratible, cranky, and sleepy all day long.<BR>

Would I suggest XTC? yes. Is the 'hangover' worth the 'high'? That depends on what you have to do the day after you take it. If you have to work or go to school, then NO!!! If you can lay in bed all day, watch tv, and drink water, HELL YES!
