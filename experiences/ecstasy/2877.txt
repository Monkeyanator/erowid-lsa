It was my first experience on what I think was an E, and with people I had met the night before. We went to a club & hung in a dark crowded room full of strangers. It wasn't a planned thing that night. But did it ever change my perception of things!<BR>
<BR>
I started off with half & became impatient & there were no effects, so took the rest if it. I'm extremely tiny and when it hit me, it took me. <BR>
<BR>
I felt unreal. Even the tiniest movement felt so enlarged and huge. A rattle of a twinky felt like a throw of the arm, and I new it hit me. I danced and felt so happy.<BR>
<BR>
We changed rooms in the club and it was darker and hotter in the room. There were faces in the crowd that were making paranoid, but I spoke to everyone - feeling like they could see right through me.<BR>
<BR>
I was dancing most of the night, and panicing at the same time. I kept comming and going and people aroud me knew I was having a bad one, they would come to me and calm me down but at the same time I knew there was something wrong.<BR>
<BR>
I had about 4 different mind frames when I dancing - then coming back to myself and telling everyone I'm ok.<BR>
<BR>
But to go to the toilet  on my own was the hugest challange to me and I didn't want to leave where I was. Finally I got angry at myself for feeling so scared & walked myself to the toilet. The girls in ther helped me feel better about the experience. I felt like I was saying things twice and ashamed in a way. My heart was racing so fast and my eyes were pulsing in the mirror. But at the same time I had never seen my face so alert and alive.<BR>
<BR>
Went back to dance. Started panicking again. Then I thougth the worst thing is death. I truly thought I wouldn't see the next day. It was 7am in the morning and I was still dancing and I knew I couldn't go hm to my parents yet. They would definately give me a heart attack.<BR>
<BR>
I had driven home - heart still juming out of my chest & still dancing in the car to stay sane. For the rest of the day my friend took care of me but I was too scared to sleep, as I had a big chest pain earlier. She made me herbal tea & I finally chilled.<BR>
<BR>
I was so happy to wake up the next day! I really didn't think I'd see the next day. I Went to work - so disorientated and still trying to figure it all out. I did get depressed, however & had thoughts of leaving my job etc, but I got over it! and I'd prob. do it again.   : )
