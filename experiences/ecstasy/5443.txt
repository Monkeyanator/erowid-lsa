Last Satruday night I was left to my own devices and ended up at the biggest gay dance club here in San Francisco.  I was there the weekend before with a friend and had a blast (consuming only beer).<BR>
<BR>
As usual, the line was quite long.  I struck up a conversation with the guy in front of me who turned out to be an E dealer.  The next thing I know, I was buying a tablet from him for $20.  I had only done E one other time, about 16 months ago, but this would be my first time doing it a giant club.  I swallowed the pill around 11pm and waited...<BR>
<BR>
45 minutes later, while out on the dance floor, the feeling of euphoria took over me and I was hearing the thumping club music on a whole new level.  I had been dancing with a group of guys who were already tweaking and I was now on their level.  We danced hard, rubbed each other and kissed.  It suddenly dawned on me that just about everyone in the club was on E!  I couldn't remember a better time dancing and every song was my favorite song for the 7 minutes it was on.<BR>
<BR>
I took several breaks to walk around the club and rehydrate.  Just the simple act of bumping into people touching them as I walked by was incredible.  At one point while returning to the dance floor, someone grabbed my arm.  I turned around and it was a cute, buff shirtless guy and he said hi.  We started talking and my normally shy nature was nowhere to be found.  The conversation flowed so smoothly.  We went out and danced and kissed.  Kissing must be my favorite thing to do while on E.  The feel of his tongue on my lips was incredible.  I asked if he was on anything and he said he wasn't.  I was a little bummed, because I wanted to him to be on the same level as me.<BR>
<BR>
We went upstairs to the lounge to chill and I was the most talkative I had ever been.  Unfortunately, he was getting tired and wanted to go home.  He invited me over and I had to weigh the options of staying at the club and continuing my E adventure, or going home with him which would mean I wouldn't have to drive an hour home.  I opted to go with him.  <BR>

Back at this place we smoked a little pot and tried to have sex.  Maintaining an erection was next to impossible, so it just wasn't working out.  After a restless night sleep, we tried to have sex, but I couldn't come to save my life.  I spent the rest of the day at home, recovering.  I love being on E...I just wish the next day wasn't so bad!!
