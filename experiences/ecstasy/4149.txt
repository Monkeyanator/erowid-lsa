I have taken ecstasy about 10 times in a number of environments and I feel a loss of magic in the drug.  I remember the first time I took this drug, I was overwhelmed with emotions I have never felt.  It was unbelievable.  But now, its nothing special.  I think it is because i learned to control my roll.  I know how to handle it now.  <BR>

Before, ecstasy took me over.  I couldn't control myself.  Now, after the 10 times I have rolled, I'm not overwhelmed anymore.  Its nothing special now.  Another factor is the crash.  I feel SO AWFUL after a night on ecstasy that I think I would be better off not even taking it.  As soon as the peek ends, I feel drained of all energy.  I am usually depressed for the next 3 days.  Ecstasy isn't even worth taking for me anymore.
