A friend of mine called me one night and asked on the spur of the moment if I wanted to take ecstasy.  Having taken the drug once before, and having an extremely pleasurable experience, I quickly agreed.  My friend, let's call him Danny, picked me up and we went to this club.  I could tell when we got there that Danny was already rolling, and about 10 minutes before we left the party he slipped a pill into my hand and asked if I 'needed to use the bathroom before we left.'  This was at about 2 in the morning.  I noticed in the bathroom that the pill was a doublestack, and not sure how strong it would come on I popped the pill anyways.  I also didn't take in consideration the fact that I had eaten an early dinner (at about 4pm) and nothing since, making it 10 hours since I had anything in my stomache.  Maybe if I had put two and two together, things would have gone differently.<BR>

Right after I came out of the bathroom, we left the club.  I offered to drive since Danny was already rolling and I wouldn't start to feel it until we got home.  Thank God he didn't let me drive.  Approximately 20 minutes after I took the pill and 15 minutes away from home, it hit me hard and fast.  My whole body felt soothingly on fire, but it was at the same time uncomfortable.  Then I started to freak out.  The lights passing on the side of the road were wizzing by in endless traces, and I began to feel sick.  Danny pulled over so I could throw up, but since my stomach was so empty I did nothing but dry heave.  <BR>

When we finally got back to Danny's apartment (approximately 45 minutes after I dropped the x tab), we realized we were locked out, and I still had to puke.  Just my luck.  My eyes were jittery, and every movement looked the way things look under a disco ball, but worse.  I was scared, beyond wired and jittery, and hot and tingly to the point of almost burning.  Every sound was amplified beyond belief and very distant.  I felt like I was being separated from life, or reality, or both.  <BR>

Danny's neighbors were so nice and let me use their bathroom, so Danny took me in as I tried to throw up again.  I told him I didn't like what I was feeling, and asked him how I could come down.  Danny asked his neighbor's, who were also familiar with ecstasy, how to come down from a bad roll.  As I was laying down on the couch, some guy said,'Come down from a bad roll??  Uhhh, you don't.'  I suddenly became overwhelmed with fear, and my thoughts of me dying right then and there wouldn't stop crowding my mind.  I laid on the couch, shivering with fright while Danny held my hand and told me I would be okay.  Then the song 'Hey You' by Pink Floyd came on, and all of a sudden everything was okay.<BR>

Abut an hour to an hour and fifteen minutes after I took the roll, this warm feeling came over me, and I could feel it relax my body from head to toe.  I could almost feel the seratonin flooding through my veins, inch by inch.  I told Danny and his neighbors how sorry I was for freaking out and thanked them beyond belief for their love and kindness.  Then I got a notion in my head.  I began to wonder about the term 'bad roll', and somehow convinced myself that there was no such thing as a bad roll.  I thought everyone else in the room was laughing at me for thinking that I could be having a bad roll, when I simply hadn't started to peak yet.  The good part about the whole thing was that by that point I didn't care b/c I loved them all so much. <BR>

The rest of the night went along as smoothly as a night of ecstacy should, although I did have some black outs.  The next day we watched a video of the night before, and even seeing myself on TV didn't trigger any sort of memory of that point in the night.  I still find that a little disturbing, but it made me very glad I was with people I knew and trusted. <BR>

It boggles my mind to think that in the same night I had the scariest 30 minutes of my life, and the best 5 hours of my life.  In order to help all those curious X virgins out there, here's some advice.  Don't do it, ignorance is bliss.  But you're going to do it anyways, and you're going to love it.  Just be sure to eat something not too long before you take it, and be prepared to have your brain feel like horseshit rattling around in your head the next day.  X hangovers are the worst.
