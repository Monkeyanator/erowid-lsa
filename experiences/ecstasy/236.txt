This weekend, I did XTC for my second time.  Last weekend being my first. My first time doing it, it didn't kick in for about two hours.  I am on medication, called Dexedrine, so after like an hour I wasn't rollin' I was getting pretty worried that it wouldn't work because of my medicine, but it finally kicked in.<BR>

I rolled for a good five and half-hours, it was a blast. I wanted to hug everyone; there was mad love for everyone.  I came to realize that was the best trip I have ever had.  So I was so excited to try it again, I went out and bought some cool lotion because I sure did use a lot of it last weekend, and I got all prepared to have, well lets just say fun.  So finally Saturday was here and I was so stoked.<BR>

My Boyfriend and I both dropped (blue surf) about 6:15 p.m.  One of my friends has been chewing candy for a long time, so I went to him with all of my questions.  I started to feel a little sick about 20 minutes after I took the pill, so I asked him what was going on and he said I was peeking and I should get up and move around, so I did.  After that I felt great, like I could go out and run a marathon, a little different than the last time I rolled.  My friend also helped me out a little with glow sticks and put on some tight music, so I was feeling real good after that, until the cops showed up to where we were.<BR>

We had to leave there and go somewhere else. We couldn't find anywhere to go so we ended up at a friends house.  It was so boring I stopped rolling after about three hours.  I was so mad.  Everyone else was still rolling but me.  My immune system must suck.  I took Blue Smurfs this time and last time Green Nikes.  I definitely recommend XTC to everyone.  It's the best feeling.  I just wish I would have rolled longer. :)~
