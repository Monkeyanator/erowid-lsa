I`ve been taking estacy for 2 years now, on every weekend as we go out. It started out as one a week but it got stupid, as the months went on the amount became larger. To date we are taking 6 or 7 and an eighth of speed. I know i am addicted but i enjoy the buzz and rush you get. Your in a different world and everyone understands you.<BR>

The last two weekends have been disasterous as a friend collapsed and had her stomach pumped, thankfully she is alright now. The week after we went out and did the same routine again. I was flying until we dropped our 8th pill i started to have bad chest pains and trouble breathing. I got some fresh air to relax the pain but i got sick. After this i was much better but i know there's a risk now, which scares me. Our group has decided to cut going out down to every 2 weeks, this will stop us from taking them as we only take them as we go out. <BR>
