I take ecstacy quite frequently and love it but always run into 'difficulties' in the post-trip stage. WHY? Well that is why i'm posting this information, hopefully someone can relate to it and give me an explanation.<BR>
<BR>
I will tell you about the first time i took E's.<BR>
<BR>
I went to a rave in South Africa two years ago and before leaving for the rave the group of friends and i met up at a bar and took 1 CROWN ecstacy tablet.<BR>
<BR>
About 10 minutes later we hit the rave and nothing had happened yet so we sat at one of the bar area's and had a couple of shots of Schnapp's and spoke for a while listening to the music bellowing from the dance floor. About 15 minutes later the music became irresistable and I had to go and dance, now feeling very lively and thinking very naively that this was it.<BR>
<BR>
About ten minutes after that something happened that quite frankly scared the shit out of me. I was dancing and having a great time and WHAM!!!! it hit me for a six.<BR>
<BR>
I staggerred off to the side of the dance floor and sat down feeling very disorientated, clostraphobic and to top it off scared. All that went though my mind was flashes of newspaper headlines of people dropping dead after taking E's. The feelings I had were like a ten ton anxiety attack and the thought of death was large. I had to get away from the crowd and the warmth, I had to get to some cool, calm place where I could concentrate on breathing! YES concentrate on breathing! I had to think about breathing properly because I felt so out of breath it hurt!<BR>
<BR>
By that time my friend, who was a veteran E' taker had noticed and came to my rescue, he took me straight into the toilets and placed me by the sink and told me to run cold water on my hands and face while i was doing this he just spoke calmly to me and told me not to worry and that this was normal for some people, not that that helped because all I was saying to him was 'I'm going to die I'm going to die' and honestly I thought I was.<BR>
<BR>
After about what seemed an hour this 'phase' passed and I started to rush and eventually dropped a speed capsule and had a whale of a time but you all know this part of the trip so I won't carry on this story.<BR>
<BR>
The point is that this happens to me with about 90% of the E's I take, the differance is I expect it now and when it does I simply go outside and sit with a friend and try to take my mind of it until I start rushing but don't get me wrong I am still terrified.<BR>
<BR>
DOES THIS HAPPEN TO ANYONE ELSE? and DOES ANYONE KNOW WHY? HAVE I GOT A BAD HEART OR SOMETHING? SHOULD I STOP TAKING E's? AM I MORE SUSCEPTABLE TO THE EFFECTS? WHAT?. If I boost up in a night it doesn't happen, no matter how much more I take, it only happens on the first drop.
