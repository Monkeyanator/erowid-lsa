I usually start about 11pm. The 1st couple of times trippin were just 1/2 hits. I dont remember any hangover of any type.I think I started having the hangover effect when I got up to 2 in one nite. And when I tripped both friday and saturday, Monday I'd be half dead. real easy to pass out, very weak,could only lie in bed all day<BR>

I started taking 5 htp to ease the hangover, and then to extend the rolling (peaking). Then I got this vitamen mineral mix for people who do recreational drugs, it's called neuro clear. It seems to help alot.<BR>

Now I'm up to 5 in one nite, the next day your still tripping, But it ain't no fun at all, because of the physical hangover. I also been getting these canker like sores on my tounge, I think it could be the 5 htp, a friend gets them too, but only since he started the 5 htp. or we were thinkin that it could be from chewing on our tounges.<BR>

I can't see doing it as much in the future because i'm 46 years old its so bad afterwards, and it costs so dam much.
