Wow.....I don't even know how to begin. It was a Friday night, I had some friends who were party kids so I had heard a lot about E and looked a lot of things up. Anyway..a good friend called me up on Friday night at 11:00 and asked if I wanted to goto a rave. With enthusiasm I agreed.<BR>
<BR>
We drove the hour to the party, and met one of his friends there. She went to parties every weekend, so she had a lot of experience. When we walked in the music was sooo loud and sounded great. Nikki,my new friend, offered to get some pills for us, my friend and I gladly accepted, handing over $40 each. She returned with 4 pills, two for my friend and I. My friend Mark and I took one each right away and went to go chill for a while and let the effects kick in.<BR>
<BR>
T+0:45 I began to feel the on rush of emotion, I had to talk with Nikki non-stop. I told Nikki that I loved her and thanked her so much, with many hugz and kisses, then I got up to go dance, the music was just calling me. I must have danced for an hour straight, but after what I had read I went to find some new friends to chill with, and drink some water. While hugging all my new friends, I realized how amazing texture was, skin, clothes, denim, cotton, and my friends all gave me bracelets, and I sat there moving them up and down my arm for that feeling. So I took the other pill wanting to extend the experience as long as I could.<BR>
<BR>
About T+2:30 Nikki sits down blows on me with one of those vicks inhalers. Some one handed me a vicks mask and Nikki was rubbing my back, it felt so incredable, I felt so obliged to return the favor, Mark comes up and meets all the people I was talking to. I went and danced more, I'm not much of a dancer, but everything just seemed to flow, I smiled all the time. I was in heaven. It's hard to describe how great everything felt<BR>
<BR>
But, alas the party ended around 6:00 am and I was still rollin. Watching the sun come up was a spiritual feeling, I felt reborn. On the drive home i had a bottle of water, and not realizing the cap was off and the bottle was in my hand, and the water dumped alll over my back. Which was an experience in itself.<BR>
<BR>
Just a few things to add, for anyone else wanting to try e, know your dealer, drink about half a liter of water every hour, this keeps all those bad efffects to a minimum.
