Hello I just thought i'd tell about my roll.  See i dont do drugs that often. I just moved out of my grandparents house see im 16yrs old and was well doing what i wanted and living the life i wanted to live. While on XTC i thought about lots of things i wouldnt normally think of like the way i treat others and what I want in life and so on.....On XTC i relized that i didnt have the best attitude and that i wasnt thankful for the wonderful blessings i had. After about two weeks of thinking after the roll i decided that my grandparents need me and that i need them. I moved in with them and i have gotten my life straight, Im going to school, i have a job and all that good stuff. <BR>

XTC made me look at life in a different perspective and for that im truly thankful!!!
