It was the night of a football game.  Me and my friends decided to roll our nuts off on Ecstasy due to my friend Zaks B-day. I picked up about 44 pills of Pink Ck's.  We all took one before the game and throughout the dance.  These seemed to keep me in a Europic mode for a much longer time than normal.  So i figured they were very pure.  When we got to my house we partied all night.  I ended up taking 5 more.  We stayed up all night and i was extremely fucked up!!  I felt in a dream world beyond belief.  At 5am we did after hours in a club in chicago.  We partied and i took a clover down there.  The next morning all of a sudden my lips started burning and swelled up.(Due to that they were very dry the entire time)  <BR>

I was very 'Cracked out' in a way that i couldnt stop talking, depressed, my motovation was gone, and my lips looked all deformed.  The following night my cousin came over.  I yet still didn't get any sleep and was restless. Lips still swelled, and mouth torn to pieces.  We bought 4 candy canes so i took one.  I felt a kick in about 3 minutes!!!  The quickest ever i had experienced.  When i looked in the mirror an hour later, my lip was enormous, i mean i thought it fell out of my mouth.  So we left.  I cant imagine what the car ride was like, i heard football games, people, cheering, all this crazy shit.  I looked in the mirror and my eyes freaked me out sooo bad i almost cried.  <BR>

I'd never been this fucked.  My lip getting worse and worse.  We ended up going to the hospital and they pumped a shitload of benedril into me.  I slept for about an hour and hallucinated my ballz off.  I thought my mom and dad were hiding behind the curtain, my friends yelling down the hallway, and my sister peeking everywhere.  I woke up and the crickets on the hospital curtains were dancing. My lip swelling went down and he said I got a saviltary gland disease.  With my lip looking worse than before, but not at the second swelling time, i went home and finally passed out.  I still, to this day, have hallucinations of red dots, electrical red rays, and all this red line shit.  After that i have not been the same.  But i still roll my nuts off every weekend, just less dosage.<BR>
