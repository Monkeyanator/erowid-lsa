One night my friend 'Coco' and I were planning on rolling after a bad week at school and problems with friends.  She has rolled before many times, but I however had never done anything besides shrooms (which I hated), Weed, and Alcohol.<BR>
<BR>
We lied to our parents and said we were going on a random shopping trip and we would be home around 12 because we were going to catch a movie after and then hit a local restaurant.  No sooner did we get to the mall that her boyfriend Steve came to pick us up.<BR>
<BR>
He took us to the gas station to get cigarettes.  He came out with those but also with 3 giant bottles of water.<BR>
<BR>
'I have a surprise for you', said Ryan<BR>
<BR>
He pulled 2 small white pills with blue dots in them (a blue smurf.)  I was excited and a little nervous, but I assured myself I was going to be fine.  I took the pill at approx. 8:15 p.m.  We began driving around to random places, soon enough Coco's hit her.  We went into a bathroom and I noticed how huge my pupils were getting.<BR>
<BR>
As we were on our way back to Ryan's house, a few good songs came on.  We began dancing and singing and then Ryan's hit him.  I was feeling a little bummed out because they were having so much fun and I hadn't felt anything.  We arrived at Ryan's at approx. 9 p.m.  We went up to his room where he has some real cool black lights and disco balls and we put on some disco and started dancing. <BR>
<BR>
All of a sudden I felt this exhilirating sensation come over my body.  Coco took one look at me and knew I was definetly rolling.  We began to dance harder and faster and it was great.  Coco and Ryan wanted a little alone time for whatever, so I went into the computer room and got online.  I made up with my friends I hadn't talked to in awhile and I felt so wonderful.  I was grinding my teeth because it felt so wonderful and I was rubbing my hands so hard.<BR>
<BR>
Soon I was back with Ryan and Coco and we all told each other how much we really cared about each other.  I was never a big fan of Ryan either but then he said the sweetest thing ever about an incident that I had been getting hell for at school and I felt so connected to him and it was wonderful.  Coco and I realized that we are the truest of friends out of all of us that hang out.<BR>
<BR>
The next morning when I woke up, I was still feeling it.  I'll never forget my first time ever.  It brought me closer to 2 people I love and care about and it has done the same the last 3 times I've done it.  <BR>

It is a great drug if used properly and it can help you find yourself in a lot of ways. I feel it is a safer drug then most of the 'in' drugs now.  Be safe, drink water, have fun, and most importantly surround yourself with people you trust, because it is very easy to let your guard down too much.
