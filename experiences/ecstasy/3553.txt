About two months ago, my boyfriend and i decided to go out and celebrate his birthday at our favourite club in Sydneys inner city. Accompanying us were ten of the finest pills (or so we thought) around Sydney at the time. <BR>
<BR>
We were both feeling quite euphoric after dropping the first two pills, and decided to pace ourselves, (around a pill every two/ three hours). Time pased us by unnoticed (as it tends to to when on ecstasy) and we realized that it was about time to dump another. We decided to do this at our hotel room we had booked earlier for the next day. <BR>
<BR>
As we entered the room we swallowed yet another tablet. Hours passed, and there we were chatting mindless bullocks, when realizing that the inevitible had happened....morning had broken and we were begining to come down. Feeling a little 'under the weather' i decided to have a shower and get comfortable. A task which was unfortunately easier said than done. <BR>
<BR>
The minute i walked in to the bathroom i was horrified to see that i was bright orange. Hepatitis C. I was convinced just by looking at my reflection that i had contracted hepatitis. I quickly alarmed my boyfriend who also claimed that he was orange, but after looking at his complexion i was assured that that the only thing we had contracted was a small batch of paranoia. <BR>
<BR>
After having my shower, i lay down and tried to get myself as comforatble as i could, deciding that now was not a good time to take another pill (one of my great motos when taking drugs is 'when in doubt say no' no one wants to relive the tragedy of <A HREF='http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/mdma/mdma_health5.shtml'>Anna Wood's Story</A>) <BR>
<BR>
I was just beginning to nod of to sleep when suddenly i would think up an excuse to open my eyes, the weirdest and warped excuse possible, but without fail every time i thought myself asleep there would come along an antagonising thought. One time i opened my eyes to what i thought was one of the hotel staff staring at me from the end of the bed. My boyfriend at the same time was also in his own coo coo world. <BR>
<BR>
I thought to my self there must have been a lot of speed in the pills because the sleeplessness and the paranoia tends to only happen if i take speed. i rolled over to give my boyfriend a kiss but had to stop immediately after convincing my self that i was kissing a female. He too thought the same. <BR>
<BR>
By this time we decided that these pills had a terrible come down and some very hard core side effects. Normally i find that if i dump the next day the harsh thump of reality is not so bad. So my boyfriend and i decide to have another. Big mistake. Although i was feeling a little less insane, i started feeling very unwell in the tummy. Stomach churning is one of the main reasons i no longer take speed. In order to stop the churning, i spent the next hour vomiting. <BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile my boyfriend was burning up with a fever. A bath seemed to help that problem. <BR>
<BR>
Eventually were were both able to think clearly again. We had valium, but thought it best not to take them in case of any more problems. So we ordered a couple of drinks from room service and evenutally fell asleep. <BR>
<BR>
After that experience, i decided to 'take a break'!
