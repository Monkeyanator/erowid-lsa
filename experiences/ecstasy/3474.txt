Every since the first time I have tried ecstacy, I just thought it was the most wonderful thing and wanted to do it again and again.  I'm starting to wish that I have never taken it.  I get extreme, almost suicidal depression after use now.  It never goes away and the only thing I can do to help is drink on my resting days and then just take it again.  When I am sober I get very easily aggravated and I get the feeling that people are just stupid and just serve no purpose.  I feel like something inside me is wanting to get out and I get restless and sweat a lot too.  I just know if I quit I will never stop thinking about doing it again.  I think that ecstasy is going to ruin my life.
