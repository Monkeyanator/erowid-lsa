I had recently had some strange experiences with Ecstacy. I am a frequent raver and I do Ecstasy often (usually 3-5 pills a night) 1 to 3 times a week. I drink pleny of water and my pills usually take 30 - 60 minutes to start working.<BR>
     <BR>
As I am lying in my bed (usually occurs 2 nights after my doses of E) I start to fall into a deep sleep, then, all of a sudden i hear a loud, WOOM WOOM WOOM WOOM, noise in my head (almost like doing nitrous). I usually am in a half awake and half asleep state (limbo) and I have no control over my brain. Its like my mind is awake, but my dream continues to occur. I have had my eyes roll back into my head and my arms go numb on some occasions. I basically have to struggle to wake up. It is very frightening. <BR>

On one occasion I was lying in my bed getting ready to fall into a deep sleep when, all of a sudden, it sounded like a jet air plane crash landed in my ear. Just one loud WOOM. I guess i really didnt give it a chance to make any more noises. I jumped up very quickly and looked rapidly around my room, until I realized what had happened. I sat on my bed with my eyes wide open, thinking that I was never going to get better, just worse. Eventually I found out that its just temporary.<BR>
     <BR>
It usually occurs for five to seven days (if i have stayed clean on E during that time frame). And if I do more E, the same symptoms come right back.<BR>

Ive had a few friends tell me they have the same problem with waking themselves up from a dream. But none have experienced the loud, frightening sounds like I have. I wonder if I'm the only one? I dont feel that I have lost any of my memory or and motor skills while being awake. I just have no understanding of what, or why, that is happening to me and if this is temporary now, but may have long term effects!<BR>

My experiences have been occuring for a month now, at first I was not used to the noise and the probems waking myself up. Lately I have been somewhat been getting immune to the problem. I can now say that the problem still does persist, but I am able to deal with my problem<BR>

If anyone has the same problem I do please seek medical attn. After i finish this letter, I am calling my doctor and asking for advice.  Better safe than sorry!
