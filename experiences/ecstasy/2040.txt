First off, whoever invented this shit--you one helluva person! My very first experience gave me the best feeling I had ever had in my life. I made sure I was prepared, so I asked friends who had done this before, and got a lot of advice. Number 1 thing---either get a whole lot of gum and/or a pacifier. You're gonna be chewing on ur gums right until you come down. Second--make sure ur around people you know, and have plenty of water. This shit makes u wanna drink a lot of water [and can also dehydrate people, so it's important to drink some water throughout the evening]. Most importantly, before you roll--do NOT eat, you will seriously get sick all over the place, and if you do get sick, you'll think its the roll and you'll never wanna do it again, when in actual fact ur missing out the best kinda drug there is! <BR>

It was about 3 months ago that I rolled for the first time. I was really determined to try this drug, but never really got down to getting it. Soon enough I was overwhelmed by my curiosity and had to indulge in this thing called 'X-ing'. I was with a few friends, and they're practically all best friends, so I felt comfortable with it. Everyone around me also took the pill. It was Ash and mines first time--so we were really rolling face by the time we were 'up'. First we sat and relaxed-watching a tiny little black and white tv. I felt as if i was sitting outside of my body, that's how relaxed i was. I had my eyes focused so deeply into the tv, that everything around the tv was moving and swirling. My friend poked me as i was being so quiet, i was just so caught up in this feeling of relaxation. My friend looked at me and told me she was getting mad because she felt she had wasted her money because she wasn't feeling anything. We got up to go smoke a cigarette which sounded so good at the time. As we were walking down the stairs, i felt as if i was being carried down the stairs. My body was so light, it was crazy to think it was even me. Suddenly, Ash looked at me and just got this big smile on her face. Her roll had kicked in. <BR>

We went outside and went and sat on the porch. I was so overwhelmed by the beauty of nature at this point, that i had smoked my whole cigarette already. It's amazing sitting and realizing that there's all this shit around you everyday, but you don't take notice of it all! You feel so confident when ur rolling, and trust me on this one--depending on who you are, you feel capable of doing anything--me--for instance, i was dancing in front of a group of people, not getting too hot tho, other wise, u don't feel that good. You feel so horny at one point, u can start touching others or ur self, or just something you love. Im known for hugging everyone when i roll. Im told im the cutest thing, and that of course sets me off when I'm rolling, cuz thats just another boost of esteem. The next day, I didn't feel in the least bit shitty, I felt good as hell. Honestly that shit is addicting, im getting ready to do some more next weekend. One thing, don't do it over a long period of time, other wise soon enough u'll be taking rolls and nothing will happen because ur body has not yet exported the roll. It is the best feeling. I try everything once, but this is one thing I'm going to do whenever I want to have a good time and just feel like the best thing in the world!<BR>
<BR>
To all that haven't tried it, no pressure--but trust me, and other people who have done it, there's a first time for everything, and this first time will be the best time.<BR>

To all other raver's and people that roll out there---keep rolling, be careful, and most of all, I love all you guys!! :-)
