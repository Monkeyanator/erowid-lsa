I have been taking pills for about 4 months, in a purely social way. When I go clubbing, I may drop up to 3 pills to make the night go with a real BANG!<BR>
<BR>
The effects I have from taking ecstacy are one of complete emotional connection with friends. I have so much empathy for people I want to talk for ever. I can sit and talk about absolute cod-shit just because I feel a true bond with whoever I am talking to.<BR>
<BR>
The only problem is that you can become very down when you notice the effects wearing off. Last weekend, to combat this I was taking a pill at least every hour, until I had taken at least 11. I think this was the overall amount, Im not quite sure. <BR>
<BR>
The effects of 11 pills were completely adverse. I felt sick, weak, shakey, tired, dizzy, dissorintated all at the same time, with a paranoid fear I was going to die if I fell asleep. I eventually went home and slept for 18 hours. I felt fine the next day, but could not urinate for at least a further 24 hours; weird.<BR>
<BR>
I recommend MDMA, but in moderation, as with anything else. I suppose I am an obbsessive person who needs to take things to extremes.<BR>
