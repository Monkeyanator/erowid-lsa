I seem to be one of the unlucky people that 'crash' very hard although i have noticed it (obviously) being worse with stronger pils or higher in-take. <br>

My experiances often range between the following:<br>
<OL><br>
<LI>Self Consiousness: A sense that everyone is looking at me and talkin about me.</LI><br>
<LI>Feeling dirty and that people think i look dirty.</LI><br>
<LI>Feeling un-loved.</LI><br>
<LI>Jealousy: A very strong feeling that people are trying to take my girlfriend away.</LI><br>
<LI>Tiredness and resentment that it is all over.</LI><br>
<LI>Headaches and sensitive eye's.</LI><br>
<LI>Suspiciousness: Thinking that people who are talknig to you have a hidden agenda.</LI><br>
<LI>Get very up-tight and moody and just want to go home.</LI><br>
<LI>Very emotional and weepy about past events (usually with speed).</LI><br>
<LI>Insomnia.</LI><br>
<LI>Still an uncontrollable appreciation of music e.g. i could be brushing my teeth and dancing to music in my head.</LI><br>
