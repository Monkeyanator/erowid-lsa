I went to an 'all-night-rave-dance-party' earlier this year. It was small, had all the good stuff playing and overall had a pretty good vibe. I came to the party with out any 'suibstances' however with the intention of finding some when I got there. About and hour and a half into it I had been asking around trying to find some E. Finally I bumped into a friend who said that a guy she came with was selling; so I got hooked up with some, 'cu.' Having a very good experience with, 'cu,' a few weeks before, I was quite pleased to have come across such luck. But, as she handed it to me she said, 'This is the second batch, it's very strong...' Well, pardon the expression but I was... well.. extremely fucked -yet comfortable and feeling good.. as people often do feel when on E.<BR>

As the night went on the shtuff wore off and I wasn't feeling to good. Said a couple of stupid things here and there, and then left to go home with the friend I had come with. On the bus, I started thinking -this led to other thoughts and more and more, with each one being more depressing than the last. By the time I got home I was ready to ball my eyes out. I lied down on my bed and must have cried for over an hour. It got to be so that I was so depressed I had to call my mom into my room so that I wouldn't do anything to myself. But this meant that I had to tell her everything... EVERYTHING. And I did. By the time I had finished telling her every single thought on life I had been having that morning, and every drug I've done (alcohol, weed, mushrooms, acid, e, (crack, once)), she had been crying her eyes out too. In the end my mom and I had become alot closer after three years of fighting and generally not getting along. I still don't know what to think of this experience yet because of it's up's and down's; maybe one day I will. But my point is, the shtuff makes you say  and do stupid things that you'll regret the next day...
