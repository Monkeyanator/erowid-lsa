You know, with all things in life there are choices.  I, myself made a few bad ones.  It all started right after New Years 2000.  I experimented with all the normal stuff: weed, cocaine, speed, you know- just about anything.  But I hadn't succeeded in getting a hold of what everyone seems to love... ecstasy.  So when my ex-boyfriend came up to my work and said he got it, why not try it, just once.  For fun.  That's all it is, a little fun right?  Well, needless to say it was.  I had never felt so good in my life.  I rolled so damn hard- I never wanted it to end.  So after that my once-in-my-life thing turned into any every weekend then every other day thing.  I took red tulips first then I would just do any I could get a hold of.  I started to sell it too.  Brilliant- right?  Wrong.  I was seventeen years old, and I considered myself an addict.  I felt the need constantly.  Well, now I'm 18 and I've quit everything.  I found out the hard way that there are effects to all choices in life.  About three months ago I started feeling kind of anxious alot.  Well, a month and a half ago I went to the doctor and was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder.  I believe it is directly related to my ecstasy abuse.  What I thought had no effects did.  My brain no longer produces serotonin (a chemical that pretty much 'keeps you happy, and from panicking all the time'). [Erowid Note: it has been suggested that MDMA use may <U>reduce</U> serotonin production in the brain, but it does not <U>stop</U> production.] I take a serotonin reuptake [sic] called celexa everyday, and have other medications for my attacks.  My one time thing has now effected the rest of my life.  Just think about things before you do it.  Everything you do has a consequence...  mine did.
