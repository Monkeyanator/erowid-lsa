My ultimate ecstacy experience was achieved at the Detroit Electronic Music Festival (DEMF). I had experienced E on three seperate occasions, with largely good results; Insight into my life, problems that I face- and their solutions, a state of contented bliss, strange psychic phenomena that go beyond coincidence. But this time was the perfect moment. <BR>
<BR>
It was the third and last night of the festival and Plastikman was spinning that night. The place, Detroit's Hart Plaza, a park-like maze of concrete and grass in the heart of downtown. More and more people had come each day, and the atmosphere was incredible. Thousands and thousands of people dancing and feeling good. It was great. I took the pill around 7:00 p.m. and went for a walk to the store with my friend. It was a beautiful day, totally sunny and hot. Came back to the sight and went into the pit to dance, whiskey-laced pepsi in hand. Maybe 45 mintutes had passed by now and I had just met some great friends of mine in the pit, when the bolt hit me.<BR>
<BR>
Out of nowhere comes the warm rush. My hair stands on end and I get that familiar cool, clammy feeling I always get. I look around me at the swirling dancers and all I can say is 'this is the best party ever!'; a phrase too corny for me to usually say. The music becomes all consuming as my body moves seemingly of its own accord. I had prepared myself by remembering to drink lots of water, so I made frequent trips to the bathroom. Each journey there was a chance to see all these beautiful people, each one's face seemingly open and good. Each one of whom I long to know. Every step feels like walking on the moon, low-gravity. Almost floating along. I am concious of the fact that I'm the most relaxed I've ever been. I am walking almost comically slowly to the observer. <BR>
<BR>
The music is ever present, bending and changing, my constant rhythm. Dancing longer and more flowingly than ever before, until my body is physically exhausted, no longer able to dance. I experienced strange physic effects. Saying to myself, 'I know B. is here...' someone I hadn't seen in months. 30 seconds later she's in front of me hugging me. I am able to locate friends for other friends who've lost them, 'yeah, I just saw him 2 minutes ago, go that way'. This among a crowd of tens of thousands.<BR>
<BR>
The peak lasts perhaps 2 hours, the comedown slow and nice. I am introduced to a new friend, who in personality and vibe, is like a synthesis of 2 people I already know. I have a strange sense of being in a different state of awareness, thinking thoughts that are obvious and make perfect sense, yet are hidden in the everyday. A girl and I walk past each other and make eye contact. About twenty feet past each other, we turn around at the same moment and say 'I know you!', even though we had met for only minutes, years before. New channels in the mind open and receiving signals from others.<BR>
<BR>
It was all about others. The beauty of others. Every person a potential friend, everyone with good aspects. I decided that this trip would be impossible to top, so why try? I haven't done this beautiful and strange substance since.
