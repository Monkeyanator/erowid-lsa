I went to new orleans with some friends of mine for a weekend of partying on bourbon. Around 3:30pm the party started.  I took 2 hits of x, about 30 minutes later i threw up the only meal i had eaten that day. After I threw up I felt a little better.  I wasn't at all concerned, many times when I had taken x I would throw up once and then be fine for the rest of the night.<BR>

We went to a friend's house to get dressed for the night.  We smoked a little weed and did some lines of coke.  On the way to the club(now @ 8:00pm) i took another hit of x. On the way to the club i made sure i drank an entire bottle of water b/c i had heard that overheating was the most dangerous side effect of x.  While walking to the club I halfed another pill with a friend.  When we got to the club i immediately got some more water about halfway through the bottle I ran to the bathroom and threw up again. Convinced that I was overheating in the hot club i went and sat outside to cool off and finished my water.<BR>

I felt a little better, just a little nauseous and shakey.  I went back in the club where my friends convinced me that my problem was that i was coming down, so i took 2 more.  We left about 30 minutes later to go to another club. On the way i drank another bottle of water. I must have been rolling so hard at this time that i wasn't thinking very well because about 20 minutes after entering the next club i took 1 and a half more.  Less than 5 minutes after taking them, i stumbled to the bathroom where i barely made it (i didn't even have time to close the door to stall) and threw up what must have been a gallon of water.  I closed the door and continued to throw up and dry heave for close to 45 minutes. I sat on the floor in the bathroom( b/c i was too weak to stand) and drank yet another bottle of water.<BR>
<BR>
Still nauseaous(and white and green) i stumbled to a couch in the club and layed there for 3 hours drinking water and feeling totally disoriented and worse than i have ever felt in my entire life.  Finally i had friends practically carry me out of the club and take me home in a cab (b/c i couldn't walk the 2 blocks back to our car).  I went home and went to bed. That was 3 nights ago i still feel dizzy, disoriented, nauseous, and i have a terrible headache.<BR>
<BR>
I found out by researching the effects of x on the internet that i probably over-hydrated myself and could have died from what has been termed water intoxication. I didn't dance or exert myself at all that night b/c i felt bad and yet b/c i had heard so many times that you have to drink water on x ( and had in the past) i drank too much and i feel very lucky to be alive.  It may not sound like such a terrible experience but i promise you it was.  I have never felt so bad in my entire life and will never take x again! <BR>

High doses, like the 7 hits of ecstasy described here, can cause immediate side effects described above, confusion, poor decision making, memory scrambling, vomiting, diarrhea, and can cause lingering dizziness, confusion, memory lapses, and depression for days or weeks afterwards in some people.]
