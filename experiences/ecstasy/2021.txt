I started raving after breaking up with a girl. I don't want to say this, but it was probably the e that got me out of my slump. When I first rolled, I saw the world in a whole new light. I just remember feeling sooo loved and euphoric. I soon forgot about my worries and sadness. That night changed me forever. I had never felt like I belonged anywhere as much as I did at the rave. This incredible techno music was tingling my bones and brain. People all around me were dancing, smiling, and hugging. It was beautiful. I became a party kid. <BR>

For anyone who has raved, this is not an uncommon story. But just recently, I discovered somthing else about E. It can be more than a party tool. I dropped a gel cap of pure mdma (apox 100mg) about a month ago with my best friend from high school. This was his first party and his first time doing e. Ever since I had started partying, I felt as though I saw the world at a different level than Grant. We were drifting apart. But that night was incredible. When Grant started rolling, we became friends again. The tension between our diferences in ideology and lifestyle was gone. This roll wasn't about escape, sex, or addiction, it was about 2 people whose lives had diverged and was bridged by the surreal underground world. <BR>

Ever since that time, I've viewed parties and rolling in a completly different light. Raving is about more than ditching worries and finding thrills; it's more about love. I've had so much more fun at parties now that I focus on the PEOPLE and not the drugs. E is amazing and I think everyone shoud do it some time in their lives. But I also think people should try partying sober. Be friendly and kind without any chemical aids. I admit it's not as fun, but the vibes you send will be out of the goodness of your heart and not cuz mdma made you do it.
