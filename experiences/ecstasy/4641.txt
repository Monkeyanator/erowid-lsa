This was my first MDMA experience.  Having now taken it over 20 times in the last 12 years, I am convinced that there was something else in the mixture besides MDMA.  I received my package wrapped in aluminum foil.  Back then, the E that was going around was not in pill form - it was a white powder.  I first heard of MDMA in 1986 and was very eager to try it.  I heard about it entirely within the context of emotional clensing and therapy.  So it was with this spirit that I took it alone, not grokking what I was in for.<BR>

5:45am:  Because of the weird hours I kept I took my dose at around 5am.  It was late May, 1988.  After about 45 minutes, I began to feel very warm and fuzzy.  Having taken LSD about 30 times already, nothing quite prepared my for what was to happen next.  Just moments after I began to feel anything at all I was very suddenly propelled into hyperspace!  Rather than what can be a nerve racking ride to peak on LSD, this rocket ride into hyperspace was the most beautifully sublime thing I have ever felt.  Everything in the Universe suddenly became infinitely perfect.  I saw what looked like the center of the multiverse - a chrysanthenum of millions of folding, morphing, fractalized, multicolored, multidemisonal geometries each containing other universes of higher intelligence and infinite love.  This unfolding seemed to go on without end.  I had no sense of my body - I was fully immersed. It was if I had merged with the heart of God/Multiverse.  I rejoiced.<BR>

6:15am: I became aware of my surroundings again and merged with the deep core of my being with unconditional love.  I soon explored rapidly what seemed like all my of childhood wounds and they become soothed and healed with this love.<BR>
<BR>
7:30am:  Being alone, I felt compelled to call my friends and family.  I ended up calling my best friend and I apologized and forgave him for any ill-will that lay between us.<BR>
<BR>
9:30am:  I felt cold, so I went out to the Hot Tub to soak for a bit.  For this first time in my life I saw gloriously beautiful aura's around everything. After about an hour I returned to baseline.<BR>

Having done MDMA a lot since then, this experience was totally unique. My suspicion is that I had taken at least a combination of MDMA + MDA.
