One night, me and my friends decided to try ecstasy at my friends house. I am 15 yrs old. We bought a strobe light and set it up in his bedroom. After we took the pill, we just lay sitting for 30 minutes. At the same exact time, me and friend screamed 'Oh my God, I'm feelin it!!' It was a wonderful feeling. Love filtered througout my body. The strobe light had such a hallucinogenic affect on our eyes that we were transfixed on it. Then me and my friend started talking. We were both extreme potheads and were doing horribly in school. We talked about our problems and how much our parents were hurting over our actions. To put things short, after that night, we made sure to do well in school and keep our mind straight. Oh yeah, we also decided not to do any more drugs.....except of course.....E
