Two friends of mine who were hardcore into the Atlanta rave scene got me into it.  I had taken ecstasy many times and my experiences with it were nice ones with the common feelings everyone describes but nothing that blew me away.  A big rave was coming up and like all the raves before this one I was really excited about going and seeing what good pills we could snag.  I had no idea this rave would change everything forever.  My two friends and I headed down to the rave and got in line early.  We were a little anxious because we showed up empty handed and getting some pills can sometimes be tough.  Out of nowhere this guy elbows my friend and asks us if we want to buy some pills.  He was selling a pill that I will never forget for the rest of my life.  It was called Double Stacked Chocolate Chip and was pure white with no markings.  We bought 4 pills at 20 bucks a piece.  Excited, we couldn't wait to get inside and get things going.  After nearly two hours of waiting in line, my 2 friends and I got inside the venue.  It was packed and hot as shit.  We bought a bottled water and headed to a dark corner where we each took one single pill.  We all thought nothing of it and headed out to the dance floor.  Nothing other than some fast food taken hours earlier was in our system.  What happened next is hard to put into words but I will try.  Expecting the same feelings to come on as they did in the past from ecstasy, we began to dance.  Its hard to remember exactly how many minutes went by while we were dancing but at about 30 mintues after we had taken the pill, godlike feelings started to overtake us.  Our strength and stamina increased and we all were filled with power unexplainable.  <BR>

Speaking now for me personally, my mind opened up in such a way that I was in another world.  I was taking problems in my life and correcting them permanently with my new mind.  I danced as hard as my body could thrash for 8 hours before taking a break.  My other friend was concerned because I was sweating everywhere but I refused to leave the dance floor.  What is so amazing is that when the pill's effect peaked, the peak never left.  Physical feelings rocked my body like orgasms as the very words of strangers near me were converted by my mind into the worship of myself.  I felt that anything anyone was saying around me was in praise of me and caused my whole body to crawl with feeling.  <BR>

What is hard to believe is that the effects of this pill lasted for maore than 48 hours.  It is something that my friends and I have explained to many ecstasy users who give us no answers as to what in the hell was in that pill.  My friends and I still talk about that pill and refer to it now as the 'Death Pill' because of the effects that were so beyond anything any of us had ever experienced.  Everytime after that night when we would go to a rave and buy ecstasy, we would become sadly disappointed because we would only feel the normal feelings of ecstasy that everyone describes. <BR>

Depression about the fact that we may never find a pill like that again often haunts us.  The best way to describe what the pill did to us was turn us into gods in every way, shape, and form.  Could the term 'Double Stacked' mean anything?  There is no way on earth that pill was just MDMA.  Through the power of that pill, I corrected my anger which plagued me all of my life.  Fears that I had were corrected while on the pill and are now gone as well.  My mindset changed forever and I am a completely different person in such a positive way.  All I can say is please somebody tell me what happened that night and what was in that pill.  I have been searching ever since that night for answers.  I have probably done ecstasy well over one hundred times in my life and never has any other pill touch the 'Death Pill.'  My greatest hope is that someone else out there will stumble upon this pill or one like it because it will change your life forever.  I tried my best to write in words what happened but I feel like there is so much missing.  I could talk to somebody about the feelings that night for hours.  <BR>
There were many things that happened that I don't even know how to begin writing about so I'll end this experience here.  I'll never stop looking for the 'Death Pill.'
