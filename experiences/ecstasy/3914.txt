I had done a fair amount of acid in the sixties, my first trip was listening to Sgt Peppers, I have smoked Marijuana on and off since I was 17 years old. In 1997 I was introduced to Ecstacy for the first time. A lot of my friends are a lot younger than me, and invited me to go to a Rave. I was a bit apprehensive at first due to my age; I was 47 at the time. But after hearing their description of the effects, I decided to try it for myself. <BR>

The Rave was in an old pump house in London, and after about an hour I started to feel the effects.  What impressed me was, so many barriers disappeared, and the atmosphere and energy of so many people with the same mindset was something I will never forget. I had always been introverted and never liked to dance, before I knew it I was dancing and moving to the sounds and was in total bliss, I danced for hours and couldn't believe how fast the time went. <BR>

We all went back to a friends house later to chill out with a few spliffs. The come down I found was pleasant enough if one didn't have too much to do, you really do need to recharge afterwards. I only take Ecstasy on special occasions, I went to Glastonbury in 1998 for the first time and overdid things a bit; over 48 hours I did about five Es three or four Purple Ohms, and Ketamine for the first time. I was as high as I could imagine ever being and danced all night and day, even in the rain. I was expecting to have a really bad come down, and to my surprise, none whatsoever. <BR>

I went to the Burning Man, desert rave in Nevada, and took Ecstacy on the night of the burn. For me the experiences with these drugs have been very positive, it beats the old club days of Alcohol and fights. I believe, in moderation there is a lot to be learned from drugs like these. How many lives have been saved by turning away from excess alchohol, to the pleasure of Ecstacy, I am 50 years old now, and very fit, my wife is 30 and I don't feel that my years of drug use have been detrimental to my physical or mental well being, and I look forward to my next adventure.
