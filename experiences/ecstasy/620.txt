I had been to raves before, but I never rolled because my boyfriend at the time was close-minded and overall against it. He was uneducated and was nervous I'd get hurt or something and he wouldn't be there to help me.<BR>
<BR>
After we broke up, I found myself at yet another rave, which I decided to roll at for the first time. I took a pill called a Genie and just waited for it to kick in, wondering if I'd even notice. All around me were pleasant happy 'candy ravers.' It was itself beautiful, and the drug only intensified this feeling of beauty. <BR>

The first thing I felt was a small rush of warm blood throughout my body. I felt a warm 'center of light' in my chest when I breathed. It was the most soothing feeling in the entire world. I smiled the biggest smile I've ever graced my face with and covered my mouth in sheer amazement. I squealed in excitement as it really hit me. I felt the music. I felt the people. I felt the vibe. I felt the venue. I felt in touch with myself. I felt a deep love and mutual respect for everyone and everything around me. I would just walk up to complete strangers and be like 'Hey! I'm Ashley.' And the people were openly nice and in no way rude. I was offered numerous massages and seabreezes and suckers. These are the kinds of people you think don't exist. And this drug opens your mind in ways I couldn't comprehend. I now accept everything. I in no way judge anyone for any reason. This drug, perfectly named ECSTACY!!!, has changed my life.  PLUR!
