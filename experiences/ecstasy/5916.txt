The first time i popped that tiny little pill, i felt like i was orgasming for 7 hours straight, the music filled my entire body and i could feel the bass pumping in my soul.  From then on i swore that raves and ecstacy were about more than just a bunch of drugged out kids looking for a good time- i knew that this was about stepping into a world of love and acceptance, and just feeling fuckin amazing!<BR>
<BR>
But, alas, these feelings of ecstacy slowly diminished the more i dosed, and now, at my 20th pill, i feel like no matter my frame of mind or how much i dose, it just isn't the same! I feel like i am no longer connected to the people around me, i am alone in a trip that isn't even half decent.  All i want is to feel that way again!
