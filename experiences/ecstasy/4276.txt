I Have Been Doin Ectasy since Febuary 28, 1999.  My first experience was so amazing.  All it took was one time for me to get hooked to the drug and rave.  I start out with one E each time and everytime the E wears off I would smoke weed to keep it going.  After E after E then I realize I had done like 15.  I told myself that I was going to stop but I keep getting urges to use it again so I did.  After like 30 E I started to feel so depressed everytime the drugs wear off.  Sometime I feel like killing my self because I feel so depressed.  I was depressed about everything even things that is not too important.  I haven't done E for a while now, but I still get the urges every now and then.
