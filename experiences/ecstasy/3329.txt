I was moved by another first time story and felt a need to write this. The story gave me flashbacks and put me at peace as I read it. I felt if I could pass on that flashback calm to at least one other person, this story would be worth my time.<BR>
<BR>
Where to begin? My best friend and I had talked about how we wanted to do this for quite a while. Out of nowhere, a friend told us we had just been hooked up. We took the pill about 8:10 that evening. The friend whose dorm room we had planned to spend that evening in had taken ecstasy over seventy times and had nothing but good things to say. Anything described as a two hour full body orgasm had to be good.<BR>
<BR>
We were told to chew it if we wanted it to hit us harder, so we did. The taste was not good but not unbearable. We chilled out for a few minutes and then went back to our friends room. After about forty five minutes we began to wonder if it would ever kick in. Our friend told us not to think about it, but that was very hard to do. All I could think of was 'I'm in college, I can't be throwing away money like this if it's not going to do anything!'<BR>
<BR>
We felt somewhat odd, out of place, but nothing like it had been described as. I know now you can't describe it at all. You have to experience it to understand. My best friend felt ill and threw up. We would come to the conclusion later that he threw up alot of the pill.<BR>
<BR>
We then smoked some weed and that must have killed my attention span because as soon as I stopped thinking about how I wasn't rolling, the roll hit me like a freight train! Out of the blue, I asked our experienced friend to mess with me or something because I wanted every feeling that had been described to me. Mess with me is not the right phrase. He manipulated my senses like I never knew they could be.<BR>
<BR>
He told me to curl up in a ball and hold my legs in tight. He stradled me in a sitting position on the floor and picked me up and rolled me around on my back. I thought I had flown out the window and was in a pure freefall! Just as I thought it couldn't get any better, he starts shaking me. I sounded like a porno, 'I didn't know I could feel this good! I thought I had experienced pleasure but nothing I've ever done can compare to this! Oh...My...God...!'<BR>
<BR>
Everything was so good and only got better. They bombarded my senses so fast I didn't know what to do. He stopped rolling me for about three seconds so someone else could rub Vicks vapor rub on my upper lip. All the physical sensations felt so good, but the emotional side was such a spiritual experience too. I was the only one rolling in the room but everyone else had done it before and they told me I was reminding them of their first time. Then I remembered how I feel when I see people get high on pot for the first time. I remember how I used to completely lose my shit and how it was the greatest feeling in the world. That increases my buzz when I see that. Suddenly I realized how I was making them feel, and that only made me feel better about making others feel good.<BR>
<BR>
I'm typically a major introvert, but that particular night I felt like everyone in the room was my best friend. With the exception of my true best friend. I felt like his brother. I thought I was intrigued by something when I suddenly looked over to see him totally bummed. He had just started to feel something when he threw the pill up. I felt so bad and all I could say was 'I'm so sorry, if you could only be where I am.' It didn't seem odd at the time but I later thought it strange I didn't say 'I'm sorry, if you could only feel like I feel.' Our experienced friend suddenly said 'you want to give him a hug, don't you? Give him a hug!' As I hugged him I knew how non-sexual it was and it just felt right. It truly felt like I was hugging my blood brother who I love to death.<BR>
<BR>
It was a feeling, but more importantly it was an altered state of mind I had never been to before. Ordinary things took on extraordinary qualities. It was the world I had always been a part of only I finally saw the true beauty of it all. And all I could do was tell people how beautiful it all was. I wanted the entire world to feel as peaceful as I did at that moment. I felt ecstacy was the solution to the entire planet's suffering and strife.<BR>
<BR>
I also felt a bond with the 'peace loving hippies of the sixties and seventies' that I had never known. My experienced friend knew exactly what I was feeling and was kind enough to listen to each and every word I wanted to say. He knew the little pleasures, like an open ear, that would make it the greatest experience of my life. I spoke the most philosophical gibberish I had ever spoken in my life, but it all made sense. Pacifism hit me almost as hard as the pill did. I never wanted to see another violent act or hear another bad or degrading word as long as I lived.<BR>
<BR>
My best friend told me the next morning he had never seen me at such peace in all his life. And we've been through alot together. He put it quite eloquently when he said 'you found zen.' People often try to find words to describe this wonderous pill. You can't describe it. No words in any language can do the total euphoric feeling justice. Ecstacy, Zen, Orgasmic, Beauty, Absolute Purity, etc. are some of the more emotionally and physically descriptive words to use for anything and they still can't do this pill justice.<BR>
<BR>
I could go on forever about the wonderous things that occured that night but I won't drag out the details. They can't be properly described in print anyways. The lights were more vibrant than I've ever seen them, my thoughts were wonderful/beautiful/peaceful/etc., and every other thing that you experience on this drug. It can't be built up too much and you can only understand it if you experience it for yourself.<BR>
<BR>
Even if this is never used for any type of publication anywhere, I would like to thank you for a forum to pour out my experience.
