Before this all goes down I would just like to say I have rolled and had a great time with little or no after effects (mentally and physically).  <BR>

So one night I was at work and a co-worker asked me if I would like to purchase some E from him.  I gladly bought 4 and at 8:00 pm, as soon as i got off, i popped one. About an hour later i felt warm and fuzzy and all E-ish.  I started to clench my jaw and kinda chew my cheek (good way).  When I got home at about 9:00 I popped another.  I took a nice relaxing shower.  This is a great feeling on E.  I noticed though that i was starting to bite my mouth more and more.  So I made a note in my mind and tried to stop.  About a hlaf an hour passed and i popped the last 2 and continued my E night listening to music.  But i continued to bite my mouth and it got worse.  It didnt hurt but i knew it wasnt right.  I later fell asleep and awoke with cuts and gashs on the inside of my lower lip near the corners of my lip.  It was very gross.  <BR>

About two days later they evolved into the worst canker sores i have ever had.  My lip became swollen and i couldnt talk, i couldnt eat, couldnt sleep, couldnt swollow all because of these canker sores.  I had had canker sores before but these caused the most physical pain i had ever been in.  I do not do E any longer because of this and i regret having one night of near bliss for 2 weeks of near mind losing pain.
