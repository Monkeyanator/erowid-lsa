I have been taking mdma for about 6 months, not steady, but every once in a while. I have had a very hard childhood and have seemed never to get over it until this year. I am 20 years old and was sexually wronged when I was younger. I have never been a party go'er or have ever felt secure around people that I didn't know well. I never even liked to be in school for fear of being around people, I did graduate but not with many friends. I have done ecstasy about 10 times and my life has changed a great deal! I have held a steady job for one year made a lot of friends and I am not as depressed anymore, I even had the courage to get out there and dance a few times. I have not had any complaints yet as far as long term or short term memory damage, but I have on one occasion done it one weekend and then again on the next and had to take more to get the same feeling and the day after I had a throbbing head. I started taking 5-HTP about 3 months ago to assure myself that I wouldn't be hurting my body and I am doing fine [Erowid Note: 5-HTP use does not guarantee safety]. <BR>

I do find myself wanting to take ecstasy more often but I limit myself to not taking it less than 3 weeks apart. Ecstasy is very expensive here and sometimes you don't know what you are taking or even how much you are going to pay for it. Most of the time it runs between 20 and 30 dollars a pill and it could still not be the real thing.
