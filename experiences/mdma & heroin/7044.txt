Me and my friend (let's call her 'C'), went over to my friend Ray's house to hang out for awhile.... me and C had bought some Ecstasy and they were just starting to kick in when we got there... Ray asked us if we would like to smoke some heroin... we agreed... it was white powder heroin..we smoked it off a piece of tinfoil.. smoking heroin gives you an instant rush... my body felt instantly warm especially my cheeks which felt quite hot... I felt like warm jelly.. but not as sleepy as I would if I had done Heroin alone... the effects of the ecstasy made me feel very happy and very effectionate.. I wanted to hug everyone... but in combination with the heroin my jaw did not clench as much.... It's the perfect high... it's so hard to explain exactly how I felt... all I can say is that it was so good and I was so happy.... unfortunatly comming off of the drugs is hard... it has a hard down and I often feel a bit sick afterwords..and heroin makes me feel like I have a hangover... similar to the kind of hangover after a night of drinking.... eating something usually helps the hangover to go away somewhat...  I have tried this combination a few times and it's best to do the Ecstasy first... wait until you can feel the effects of the ecstasy, then smoke the heroin.. and you're garanteed a trip you'll remember and love.
