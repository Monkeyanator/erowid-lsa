It was a friday night I was at a friends house and we were all smoking weed and I had about three bowls before a friend arrived with some pcp. I was the only one who bought some. Later that night we were smoking more weed and I threw the pcp in my pipe with some weed and smoked it. <BR>

when I was done maybe 20 minutes later I began to yell very loud at every one for no reason then I uncontrollably began to swing my arms. then my friend began to complain that if I did not calm down I would have to leave and at about this point I dont remember anything. after the experience was over my friends reported that I had lost my mind, they said that I was punching holes in the doors around his house which I later saw and that I was trying to rip a toilet from the ground wich unbeilevably I did almost succeed before I began to calm down a little bit.After it was all over I could not beileve what I had done my knuckles were scabed and very sore the next day and I never in my life had been this violent or careless and I remember that I could not control what I was doing nor could anyone else cause they had been too scared. All that I know is that I will never do pcp again for me it was too scarey yet weird of an experience to enjoy.
