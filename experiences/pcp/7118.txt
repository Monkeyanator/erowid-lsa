I am a pretty experienced drug user and PCP is one of the best--IN SMALL DOSES.<BR>

The first few times I did it, I put a little on some weed and hit it from a bong.  There were no acid-like visuals, however what I did see was unbelievable.  Everything was crystal clear and shapes were very cool-looking.  I would walk into a room in my house and just be amazed at what I saw.  I saw the room (couch, tv, bookcase, etc.) as being pure art.  I would look at a painting I normally wouldn't look twice at (in fact one I looked at I had never looked at for the previous 20 years we had it) and was mystified.  I had a real jubilant feeling and an extremely euphoric sensation.  <BR>

The high set on rather rapidly (2-3 minutes) and peaked from about 10-30 minutes.  After coming down, another hit would pick me right back up where I left off.  <BR>

However, the only time I was actually scared on a drug, if not terrified, was a time that I did just a bit too much of it.  I suddenly couldn't see anything except what could be defined as a strobe light effect.  I began to get a vision of a devil telling me to become a serial killer.  I was petrified and kept saying to myself 'think happy thoughts, think happy thoughts.'  After perhaps five minutes in this state (though I'm not positive cause I was out of it) a sudden rush of intense bright colors came over me.  At this time, I realized I could handle anything any could could offer me and was ready to do it again another time (though not to that extreme.)  <BR>

All in all, PCP is a fun drug that feels very much unlike anything else I've ever experienced (which includes just about everything except heroin.)  It is not good to do very often from everything I've read and heard, though I haven't noticed any long-term effects.
