As I suffer continious headaches, I experimented with some painkillers. Most of them didn't really relief, though codeine (as found in daffalgan-codeine tabs) did a little. I'm taking it about two years at a ratio of 5 tabs a day, and I know I'm quite used to it, tough the tolerance seems to level lately. The dependance/addiction does not, however.<BR>

The doc forced me to take a one-day break from my painkillers, and what I experienced was quite frightening, because I used to think I was independant. I felt **extremely** uncomfortable, in an undescribable way. Then I went to bed, and I didn't awake for another 12 hours (note: I did slept enough before, and if I'd continued to take my painkillers, I'd been awake all day). I felt quite good by the end of the day, actually.<BR>

But, as I slowly restarted the next day, I woke up three days in a row at 3:30 AM, without reason, no matter at what time (ranging from 10pm 'till 1:00) I went to bed...<BR>

I still plan to quit them, once my headaches have gone away (treatment is underway). I think this is the typical story of sneeking-in addiction...
