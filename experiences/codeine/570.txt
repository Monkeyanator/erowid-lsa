I have enjoyed the occasional codeine ingestion through extraction methods from pills containing acetaminophen(sp?) and with prescription cough syrups.  Also with oxycodone from a surgery I had.  I drank half a large bottle of prescription codeine one night and the effects were astounding.  I became very relaxed and almost drowsy like after about 20 mins.  Your head feels heavy and begins to swim with joy.  I found myself lying in bed listening to music and daydreaming things that actually seemed reality.  Very harmonious and very relaxing...so very high.  The best body feeling one can attain.  I hear enough codeine ingested is as strong of a trip as heroine minus the rush.  I wouldn't doubt it.  The only dowfall is a bit of upset stomach may be experienced after the trip if you do not do it often.  Definately worth the effects!
