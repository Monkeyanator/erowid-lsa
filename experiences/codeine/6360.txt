I am a 17 year old Belgian guy. I'm taking codeine for about a year now (i started with 120 mg) now i take a single dose of 300 mg. I can't stay off it for longer than three weeks. I know i've fucked up my life seriously (considering i'm 'only' 17), not about the codeine, but I know what opiates can do, and I'm sure that i will try them again whenever i'm in big problems... that's the only truth. My life is 50% codeine and 50% of the rest. I take two SSRI's for a severe depression. I get very scared when I'm thinking of what i'm doing at my age.<BR>
<BR>
I'm now withdrawing (for the seventh time or so) day four, so my worst day is over. I'm sure I want things to change<BR>
i really hope they do...<BR>
<BR>
The most important thing i can say to you: when you are not feeling well, don't take codeine! You will spread out your problems over your whole life! <BR>
<BR>
I'm not saying codeine is bad or so, you really really have to know what you're doing, and i don't... <BR>
