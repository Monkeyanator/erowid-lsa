Before I start I would like to say that my fixation with pharmaceutical opiates will indeed influence this report, as I used to be hooked to methadone and dextropropoxyphene(sic).<BR>
<BR>
After many attempts at getting a satisfactory amount of codeine out of a pack of 32 co-codamol tablets (uk tablets containig 8 mg of codeine and 500 mg of acetominophen), I decided to try crushing all the tablets into a fine powder and mixed them with approx. 100 ml of COLD water and mixing the <BR>
solution well before filtering the contents. Well this appeared to improve the strength greatly from the suggested method using hot water.<BR>
<BR>
The experience that I got from this was probably equal to taking around 10-15 mg of methadone, however it only lasts around an hour. The feeling is that of any pharmaceutical opiate feelings of well-being, a relaxed and calm outlook, lethargy and perhaps slight feelings of paranoia (but that's just a personal reaction). The usual side effects occur are that of itching and indigestion.<BR>

However the main point of my report would be to say that it can be dangerous to do this more than a couple of times every week, especially if you've had previous opiate abuse problems. Ashamedly i am finding myself sliping into old habits due to the availability and low cost of acquiring codeine using this method. If you are going to do it please be careful. Love and respect.
