I would like to begin by providing some background information. What some might find a little odd is that I am not much of a drinker or recreational drug user. I had been prescribed Tylenol 3's several times over the past seven years or so for a recurring health problem. Initially, I disliked the 'high'. A bottle of 60 pills would usually last a year minimum, sometimes two or three years. <BR>
<BR>
In the last year I began to enjoy the effects. I was prescribed a bottle of Dilaudid (2mg) a few months ago and was a little upset when they dwindled away. While I don't have much desire to become an opiate addict, I must admit that I enjoy a little codeine buzz when I'm at home relaxing. For me it is the equivalent of a few evening drinks without the after-effect of alcohol.<BR>
<BR>
I came across the codeine faq and decided to try it out. I started off with small doses (Tylenol 1's, 8mg codeine), using around five pills. I now use 15 to 20 pills and find the effects quite nice. I would also like to add, in my experience, ASA with codeine far exceeds Tylenol (I have now switched). The filtration is MUCH better and the codeine concentration seems much higher. Effects usually begin in ten to twenty minutes and last for several hours as the faq suggests.<BR>
<BR>
I am a little concerned about the amount of ASA/Tylenol that is ingested with this method and was hoping that someone might provide a little input. The thought of accidentally overdosing is not very appealing, obviously. I've looked at the math and it would appear to be a tolerable dose of ASA, but if someone could put my mind at ease that would really help me enjoy the buzz a little more.<BR>
<BR>
A little extra, as far as side effects go from my personal experience:<BR>
Morphine- Large dose = intense nausea, intense itching<BR>
          Moderate dose = intense itching<BR>
          Low = ?????<BR>
Dilaudid- Mild itching<BR>
Codeine-  No ill effects
