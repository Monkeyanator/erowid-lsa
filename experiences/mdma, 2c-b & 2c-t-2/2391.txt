-------<BR>
        I've been fasting since early yesterday evening (~30 hours). I<BR>
have here one Mitsubishi pill (MDMA), 10mg of 2C-B (as 5mg pills), and 4mg<BR>
(1/2 pill) of 2C-T-2. The plan is to take the MDMA first (as 2 halves, 15<BR>
minutes apart), then the 2C-T-2 when that begins to decline, then wait 20<BR>
minutes or so for potential nausea, then eat the 2C-B. This promises to be<BR>
a good night! I've never had 2C-B before, so I'm trying to go for the<BR>
Shulgin classic combination from PiHKAL. The 2C-T-2 is only to make up for<BR>
the low dose of 2C-B, and hopefully will not too much color the <BR>
experience.<BR>
        Well, half the MDMA is down the hatch!<BR>
<BR>
11:45PM<BR>
-------<BR>
        Other half down! I think I'm already feeling the first half of the<BR>
pill! Must be the fasting... fasting can make a massive difference. Alot<BR>
of butterflies in my stomach. Bees. Wow. I've been wanting to do 2C-B for<BR>
years, since reading the old Reed College 'bromomescaline' thing. Nexus.<BR>
The elusive Erox. I hope this is as good as I've heard!<BR>
<BR>
12:10AM<BR>
-------<BR>
        Damn, the MDMA is really beginning to kick in. Only 40 minutes in!<BR>
Fasting definately makes a difference. Its been a while since I've fasted<BR>
over 24 hours.<BR>
<BR>
12:30AM<BR>
-------<BR>
        Wow... I'm going pretty good! I'm getting alot more than I have<BR>
off these Mitsubishis before! I think I need to begin fasting before trips<BR>
again. Not only does it make the onset faster and the effects stronger,<BR>
but you feel alot 'cleaner' with an empty system. I wholeheartedly endorse<BR>
a nice fast of 24 hours (or more) before most entheogens.<BR>
<BR>
1:00AM<BR>
------<BR>
        Down the hatch with the 2C-T-2!<BR>
<BR>
        I'm in a great place. I read some email a friend sent me today<BR>
which I found very touching. I spent some time thinking about that friend,<BR>
and realized she truly is one of the treasures of my life.<BR>
<BR>
        Spent some time laying down, just thinking. I love to do<BR>
MDMA-class drugs alone or with a small group of friends. Doing it at raves<BR>
or clubs is a waste. Too hectic for some of the sublter, delicious<BR>
effects. Doing it alone is especially luxurious... you can melt into a<BR>
wave of pure feeling. Lay down in a nice quiet dark room... maybe some<BR>
mellow quiet music... nice!<BR>
<BR>
1:23AM<BR>
------<BR>
        I think the 2C-T-2 is coloring the MDMA some, hard to tell.<BR>
Anyway, I just ate about one and half of one of the bees... I cut off<BR>
about half of one and crushed it, to snort. Might as well, considering the<BR>
small ammount I have. The stuff I powdered, I put into 4 *very* small<BR>
lines.<BR>
<BR>
1:40AM<BR>
------<BR>
        Schnorrrt! First bump, not too bad... Second, not too bad there<BR>
either. Two more... Third, in the other nostril - little sting. Nothing a<BR>
squirt of saline nasal spray doesnt fix... All done! Not bad at all.<BR>
Little bit of a bad taste, thats it. I assume the filler material in the<BR>
pill probably buffered it alot.<BR>
<BR>
1:50AM<BR>
------<BR>
        Definately feeling alot more than MDMA now! Im feeling sweaty.<BR>
Sorta mescaliney, but the body sensations are still all MDMA. But wow,<BR>
they're increasing.<BR>
<BR>
1:53AM<BR>
------<BR>
        Whoops, just went from sweaty hot to cold. Here come the bees!<BR>
<BR>
2:05AM<BR>
------<BR>
        Wow. Very nice. I feel very cool, almost cold, despite still<BR>
sweating a little from the MDMA. I feel very good, physically. It feels<BR>
somewhat like a low dose of mescaline, or the latter part of my 2C-T-2<BR>
experience. Not outstandingly visual (yet?) but feels great physically and<BR>
mentally. Only drawback - it seems to enhance the MDMA jaw clench quite a<BR>
bit. Small price.<BR>
<BR>
3:35AM<BR>
------<BR>
        Im in a really interesting space. VERY nice. Much like mescaline,<BR>
indeed! Similar to my San Pedro experiences, but milder on the body. I can<BR>
feel the 2C-T-2 in there, and the MDMA... but theybe all melded into a<BR>
nice whole. Colors stand out in razor sharp clarity. Very vivid, yet<BR>
natural. Mescaline-type visuals overall.<BR>
<BR>
3:45AM<BR>
------<BR>
        Wow... this has only been 10 minutes? I must be experiencing some<BR>
pretty heavy time distorions. Laying down in bed with my eyes closed I had<BR>
some great closed eye visuals. I see things flitting around the corners of<BR>
my vision with open eyes. Colors are ultra-crisp. I see little fractally<BR>
overlays over alot of things. Shimmery and spider-weblike. Similar to what<BR>
I've gotten from mescaline. Sounds of crickets outside are amplified and<BR>
reverbate - natural music. Physical sensations are amazing. Not quite like<BR>
mescaline or MDMA but about half way in between the two polarities. I can<BR>
feel the MDMAishness fading some, but the 2C-B and definately the 2-C-T-2<BR>
are going strong still! In some ways theres a GHB-ish feel to the physical<BR>
aspect. This is very interesting... and nice.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
5:10AM<BR>
------<BR>
        I'm still pretty stimulated, and my visual field is still pretty<BR>
crisp, but I'm on my way down now. Out with a little pot and GHB, then<BR>
sleep, I think!<BR>
<BR>
Conclusion<BR>
----------<BR>
        Well, it took me till near 10AM to get to sleep. Perhaps the<BR>
2C-T-2 was responsible for that. There was a long lingering effect, with<BR>
good visuals lasting the whole time. Phenethylamines are unlike<BR>
tryptamines that way... the effects are more spread out and continuous,<BR>
rather than the sharp peak, gradual decline, and long tail of tryptamines.<BR>
It was definately a nice experience, and I hope someday to get to explore<BR>
2C-B at a more appropriate dosage range.
