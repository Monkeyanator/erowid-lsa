Here's my experience with Crack Cocaine :<BR>
<BR>
The night it started my friend 'Chris' came over to chill. He introduced me to a drug called Crack which i had heard of. I had been doing cocaine(powder) for months before this with no real problem. He pulled out a small 20$ bag of crack and a short skinny metal pipe (a shooter) that is used to smoke the drug. He loaded me a 'shooter' and instructed me on how to hit the pipe. I hit the pipe till i couldnt inhale anymore, and held the hit. WOW! There is no feeling better than the 30 seconds after I take my hit (blast).I closed my eyes and felt the warm and intense RUSH run through my body and mind. I didn't care about anything else for those 30-40 seconds. All worries went away. After the intense rush faded I was still very high very much liek the regular powder cocaine high for aroudn 5 minutes. <BR>

NOW, the first time after i came down i did not fiend that bad. After a couple times of smoking crack, thinking i could control it, it changed. After about 2 weeks into smoking crack i was ADDICTED. Me and 3 others were addicted for aroudn 3 months. Durring those 3 months we had stolen large quantities of money to buy crack, sold fake drugs to get money for crack, spent thousands of dollars on the drug. All we did, and all we could think about for 3 months was to SMOKE CRACK. I cannot even explain how horrible this is. Luckily my connection to get the drug got shut down so i had no choice but to quit. If it wasnt for that i would probably be smoking crack to this day, right at this moment even. The point of me writting this is to let you know that THIS DRUG IS EVIL. IT IS PURE EVIL IN ROCK FORM. Nothing good can come of Crack coaine. If you are ever confronted with it RUN. DONT EVEN THINK ABOUT DOING THIS DRUG. I'm just warning you.
