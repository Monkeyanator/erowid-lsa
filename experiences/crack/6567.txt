I grew up in an era where if you smoked pot you were considered a druggie. I have done coke, qualudes, pot, as well as mushrooms. Stolen my moms valuim and taken handfulls at a time. Drugs are not a stranger to me. I was put in a real mental institution because I had experimented with these drugs. This is over 20 years ago and at this time there were not rehab centers there were mental institutions. I could write a book about my experiences there and the drugs I was able to get inside the hospital.<BR>

My memories stay in the back of my mind and I don't think I ever really think about it. It was my past and It was one of my first journeys through life. This is not my reason for writing. I just wanted to give you a brief background on me, to let you know, I know of what I speak. I hope you do post this so that maybe someone will think before they succumb to this black hole that crack seems to create. I never did crack I did crank a few times, although I don't ever hear anyone talk about it anymore. The high was better than any other high I ever had. I was a disc jockey at the time in Las Vegas and another jock had given me some to try before I went on the air. I remember it being the best feeling. I was on top of the world. I was perfect and funny and felt like a master at whatever I was doing for the moment. It only lasted a short while probably about a half hour. I just felt like I was the best. My head felt clear and I was unstoppable. <BR>

It was phenomenal and out of every time I have gotten high in my life, it was the most memorable. I don't remember coming down from it. My guess is this is what crack is like. I no longer do drugs. I am a mom of three boys and a single parent. Nothing can get in the way of my family, they come first and I would never jeapordize my life with them.  My sister wouldn't do that either. I am the youngest of 4 girls. My oldest sister was the best mother. So I thought. Sometimes even in your own family you don't really know what is going on. She was always there for my niece and nephew. I used to watch her and wish that our own mother would of been like her. My sister loved her kids so much she couldn't let go. She gave in all the time to my nephew. Her husband tried to make him be macho and he had quite a bit to live up to. He wasn't great in school but was really excellent with horses. He was a great rider and hung out at the stables a lot. <BR>
<BR>
At some point when he was 13 someone taught him how to smoke cigarettes. Then at some point someone taught him how to smoke pot. Then at some point someone taught him how to smoke crack.<BR>

My nephew comes from a very wealthy family. He never wanted for anything. Except there must have been something that he wanted that money couldn't buy, or it could temporarily. He wanted to feel good about himself, and the only way he could feel really good was to be high for the short amount of time that crack gave him and gives him. My nephew is an addict. I never knew what that meant. I have heard the word I have said the word but I never knew what it meant. It's kinda like when you hear someone got murdered on the news you feel bad when you hear the story but you just really want to know what the weather is going to be like tomorrow. You pass it by. I will feel sorrow remorse and pain when I hear the word addict. My nephew has broken into my sisters house, stolen her tvs and jewlery. He has gotten rental cars and rented two of them and sold them for drugs. My nephew has woken his grandparents up at 3:00 am in the morning begging for money and crying like a baby so the crack dealers don't come and get him. My nephew has been in almost every state in the US in a rehab. He has never stayed in one long enough to finish any of them. My sister and brotherinlaw have paid out over 300,000 for these rehabs. <BR>
<BR>
The police have not gotten him once.  My nephew has a 6 year old son he never got to see  ride his bike without training wheels. He doesn't miss it because he is always thinking about crack. My brotherinlaw lost his horse farm because my nephew went and sold half of the equipment and prize race horses for crack. My sister doesn't sleep. She never knows when he will call. She never knows when the phone will ring and it will be the police saying your son is dead. She waits for the call and jumps when the phone rings. She doesn't sleep. Who knows how many fights her husband and her have had over this blaming each other. <BR>
<BR>
When I saw my nephew for the first time in about two years a few months ago, I looked in his eyes and they were blank. It's like his soul had left and a shell of the person was standing before me. I knew at that time he was gone. I can't imagine anything taking over my mind my soul and my body like crack has with him. He has raped my sister of her life. He has destroyed his life, he has stepped on his sons life. My sister has been emotionally raped. Think about that and what it means. Think about a rape and the violence and the pain and the shame and the out of control feeling. Think about the helplessness. Think about someone being out of control and committing a crime and not being able to stop. Being raped is brutal, crack is brutal just like rape. You want to try crack? You want to do drugs? You don't die a quick death with drugs. It is a slow painful death and you take everyone with you. No matter how much tough love is put before you, the people that love you are screaming inside they have been raped. You will become like a tornado destroying everything in your path. <BR>
<BR>
Can you imagine taking a hatchet and chopping up your mother? Become an addict and you will do that. Crack is unstoppable. The addiction is a time release bomb. It is a pain that has no healing, and no forgiving. It leaves everyone with guilt for something they would have never felt had you not wanted to try this evil dark substance because you were hurting inside. Get a high by taking a risk of sharing how you feel with someone else. As you grow your insecurities will fade. Have some faith in yourself and in G-D. I just hope and pray that somewhere in this note someone stopped and thought twice about trying this drug. I can't stop my nephew at this point. He has to do it himself. I pray to G-D that he can.
