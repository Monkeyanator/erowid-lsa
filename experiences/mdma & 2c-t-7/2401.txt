The plan involved taking a pill, which would give me roughly 60-80mg MDMA. Sometime into the peak of the roll, I would snort about 8mg 2c-t-7.  A low-level trip, I guess.<BR>
<BR>
1.40am Took 1 Mitsubishi.<BR>
<BR>
1.55am I'm getting the usual awareness that I've taken something. It a light tingle around your face muscles. A slight heightening of the senses occurs also. Very subtle.<BR>
<BR>
2.00am Skinned up a joint. Nothing groundbreaking there. I'm becoming more chatty now.<BR>
<BR>
2.05am I feel a slight fire in my belly. Coming and going. This is just anticipation.<BR>
<BR>
2.10am I decided to put some Jerky Boys on CD. These guys are crank callers. Very funny. I was listening to music all night before this. I fancied a break to see how it would go down.<BR>
<BR>
2.17am I'm starting to come up now. Very nice.<BR>
<BR>
2.20am I'm on the way now. I yawning, smiling and I feel like dancing. He he.<BR>
<BR>
2.30am I'm up. Very relaxing now. Brilliant. Just what I wanted. Flying!<BR>
<BR>
2.41am This is my first decent pill for quite some time. Mmmm! Was I supposed to take some 2c-t-7 at some stage ? He he.<BR>
<BR>
2.50am Prepared the 2c-t-7 for snorting. Put some trance back on the stereo.<BR>
<BR>
2.55am Snorted the 2c-t-7. A hot blast to the back of the nasal passage. At this stage the pill is settling nicely. Great E buzz at the moment.<BR>
<BR>
3.00am Woo. Already I can feel the 7 bringing on a new sort of mad relaxed buzz on top of the pill. The 7 is on it's way, and has me alert now. I'm buzzing, but slowly becoming more wasted. I can function normally if I want, but why bother... Go with the flow.<BR>
<BR>
3.10am I can still separate out the two drugs. They seem to be messing with eachother for time and space.<BR>
<BR>
3.15am I am slipping in and out of different states of rolling. If I sit up and look around me, I feel washes of clarity coming over me, followed by moments where I am out of focus mentally. Visually, this is the best kind of E trip. There's very little in the line of classic 2c-t-7 visuals. This, I feel, could be the penalty of this fanastic duo. But always happy and relaxed. This is real pig-in-shit stuff. Both drugs are ducking and weaving around eachother and it's wonderful.<BR>
<BR>
3.25am Utterly launched into an E trip. E can sometimes make you go into different states of mind, like a trip. But it's always fleeting and disorientating. Like you were somewhere else, having another conversation. The 2c-t-7 fills your tank with petrol, buckles your seatbelt and allows you to go wherever you want.<BR>
<BR>
3.45am For the last 15 minutes or so, I was lying facedown on the carpet with my eyes closed. I was deep in a trip through different trains of thought. I was in a club, talking to people. It was like a strong impression, or a vivid dream, of actually being there. I could hear the trance on the stereo as music in the scenes, and the chatter of people over it. I could see everything in near-vision. It was like an strong ambient impression. Like closing your eyes in a scene, but still knowing your current environment is there. I could think about people and venues, and go there.<BR>
<BR>
4.15am The overall feeling was like nothing else. Start off with the trippiest E. Add an overall feeling of relaxation in body and mind. With a trippy E, you have no choice but to be a disorientated twit. With this, you are a lot more in the driving seat. It's like you can sit back and watch everything happen, and nod and smile in your head as you do. You can lose yourself as much as you want to, and step back. I still had the feeling that I could pull myself out of it if I wanted to. Even at the trippiest parts. However, the 20 minutes or so (which felt like twice the length) of lying on the floor were almost compulsory, I felt. It would have been an effort to drag myself up on my feet. It didn't last too long, however, and I sat up and relaxed on the couch.<BR>
<BR>
4.45am Things are calming down a little in the trip department. The buzz is still very much alive, but I am free to involve myself in anything and not just sit there thinking about it. Lots of energy. A second wind. More music...<BR>
<BR>
5.20am Hints of visuals for the last 30 mins or so. Just a fuzz and a glow. Changing the environment brings home just how much I am still up. I walked up onto the roof and watched the sun rise. Things look wavy and almost cartoon like. More like really good CGI. Very subtle.<BR>
<BR>
6.15am Relaxed and enjoying spliffs. Very contented. There is a real soft electric body buzz emerging. This physical effect on the muscles is really distinctive and is worth mentioning as a major point in the trip.<BR>
<BR>
7.10am Take 100mg 5-HTP. I try sleeping. My body is still buzzing. What an afterglow. Mad.<BR>
<BR>
Sleep was relaxed and full. There were no after-effects (other than that of the body buzz / muscle massage thingy). Although I did get the feeling that I should rest my mind for a day, and not undertake any crosswords or chess matches. No problem.<BR>
<BR>
Possible negatives: It could be a little too much for a rave (from a laziness point of view). Find a rave with big comfy chairs in. Out in public would be fine IF you are in a comfortable environment (friends, no cops, etc.). Don't expect to dance for 30-60 minutes after the 7-snort.<BR>
<BR>
Conclusion: Oh yes (banging fist on table)! Great combo. A distinct buzz and well worth doing again. Special! The only loss was the classic 7-snorted visuals (i.e. in your face!). The E seems to take over the visual field and show itself off as a fringe psycedelic. Keep the dosages modest and you will be in the driving seat all the way.
