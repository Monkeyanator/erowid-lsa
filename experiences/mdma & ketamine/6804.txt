My roommate and I were going to a big rave that night and had two and a half pills of ecstasy apiece, plus a gram of K, to sustain us through the night.  It was a 3500 person party in an old abadoned ballroom outside of NYC, so we were pretty pumped, had been awaiting the night for weeks. I took the first roll when we first got there at about 11:00 and then the second at 2 when I started to 'come down.'  (I wasn't down at all, I just wanted to stave off that post-ecstasy crash.)  In a common moment of drug-induced stupidity, I decided to snort another half a pill like an asshole.  Needless to say, forty-five minutes later I was gone, totally absorbed in the music, feeling like I could dance for the rest of my life.  <BR>

At some point, I went up to smoke a joint with some guy I'd just met on this balcony.  We were overlooking the entire dance floor and everyone on it.  The lights were shotoing out in intense spurts, and I felt completely at home.  The next thing I knew, my roommate was beside me with a bumper full of K.  He asked me if I wanted any.  Of course, I took it.  I had done K before several times (each time nasally), and I'd experience no more than a dissociation from my body, a slight change in consciousness, and a feeling of utter calm.  So I loaded up the bullet and did one huuuuuuuuuuuuuge bump.  I figured, What the hell, it's a party, loaded it again, and did one more.  Then I went to sit back down in my seat.<BR>

I think I got halfway down the aisle to the seat I was headed to. (We were still on the balcony.)  Then it was over.  I couldn't move.  I sort of slid my way into a row of seats, but I didn't sit down, just stood there and looked out at all of the people.  I felt totally numb and got this strange feeling of being a witness to the night's events. A pink light swooped over the dance floor, and all of a sudden, the light converted each person -- one-by--one-- into herbal people.  I don't know how to describe them, they looked digital and were all green and brown with these huge spiraling turbans on their heads.  And the weirdest thing was that they were sitting at mushroom tables.  Having tea, all of them with these computer-graphic-looking tentacles coming out of them.  It was by far the strangest thing I've ever seen, and I've had a lot of visuals on LSD and mushrooms.  The music took on a whining sound, like someone had put it in slow motion and was sliding the chords all over the place.  You have to understand also that my peripehral vision was GONE.  I felt like I was looking through a tunnel and yet at the same time was at one with these herbal beings and the eerie music.  <BR>
<BR>
About five minutes later, I was near enough to a consensus reality to hear about 5 people screaming at me, asking if I was OK.  One of them mentioned getting someone to help, and I just turned to her and said, 'It's OK.  I KNOW.' They were like, 'Dude, what are you talking about, what do you know?' I couldn't remember.  I just remembered a feeling of being shown something. Then it was gone.  <BR>
<BR>
To sum up the night, the K killed my roll and totally fucked me up; I couldn't dance or hardly walk for shit.  All in all, I'd say it's a cool experience -- definitely recommend it.  I've done it since with some really positive experiences, but I wouldn't do it a club or party again. Like pot -- calm and chilled.  All I have to say is be in a safe place, know the effects and your proper dosage, and expect some weird things.  Not bad, just weird.  <BR>

Happy tripping, Erowid readers!  :-)
