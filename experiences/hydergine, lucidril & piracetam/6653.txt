I have been taking a regimen of:<BR>
<BR>
1600 mg/day Piracetam<BR>
4.5 mg/day Hydergine<BR>
250 mg/day Lucidril<BR>
<BR>
for approx 3 months time now.<BR>

For lack of better control mechanisms, I have been using several software packages, including a database of several old GMAT CAT examinations(THE GMAT Verbal section is gerenally regarded as a measure of intellectual ability), and a memory recall speed and efficiency package.<BR>
<BR>
Here is a breakdown of the percentage change in scores I have experienced<BR>
Day 0 - 0% Baseline established<BR>
<BR>
Day 7 - 3% decrease from baseline in GMAT verbal, 2% increase in memory recall speed, 5% increase in memory efficiency<BR>
<BR>
Day 30 - 5% increase from baseline in GMAT verbal, 4% increase in memory recall speed, 10% increase in memory efficiency/accuracy<BR>
<BR>
Day 60 - 13% increase from baseline in GMAT verbal, 1% decrease in memory recall speed, 8% increase in memory recall efficiency<BR>
<BR>
Day 90 - 13% increase from baseline in GMAT verbal, 19% increase in memory recall speed, 14% increase in memory recall efficiency.<BR>

Granted this is not a very good indication of what effects the drugs actually have, as I am just one person, and I have emotional, occupational, and other factors effecting my life, and hence, my test performance, but I thought that the data I collected may assist others considering a regimen of smart drugs. I will update things in a few more months.
