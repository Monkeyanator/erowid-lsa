I was bored and sitting in my room watching tv. i was watching a movie channel of course, watching a movie called.. Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. I was at the scene of two guys walking into a circus and sniffing the ether.<BR>

I got curious about the experience that they were acting to be in. I decided to order a liter of it online from some chemical supplier. the chemical ethyl ether, or diethyl ether, was at one time used as an anasthetic. The liter of ether came in and I soaked some of it up in a towel and inhaled it. Shortly after the fourth deep breath of it, I started feeling light headed. Then I lost all motor skills. My nerves throughout my body were jittering with frequent jolts of energy flowing up and down my spine. I felt like I could kick anyone's ass. My brain seemed to have lost communications to my entire nervous system. For the first 15 minutes, sounds were very on and off like a diesel engine. My vision was blurred and things seemed very flashy and dream-like just like that of a marijuana euphoria. However euphoria is the wrong word to describe this experience. A better word is badass.
