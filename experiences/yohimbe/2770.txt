My experiences with Yohimbe have all been very positive. I did not use it expecting it to be psychoactive. I learned about it's effect to produce strong erections from a psychiatrist with whom I once worked. He had a patient that he injected with Yohimbine, the active ingredient in the yohimbe bark. The patient reported he had a three hour erection! I can believe that completely. My experimentation with yohimbe has been all positive. I get a little head 'buzz', but nothing I would call a high. What I do get is a guaranteed erection to sexual stimuli in at least 45 minutes from dosage. I have purchsed yohimbe OTC from Twin Lab. The after effects, following sex are continuing energy. <BR>

I used 750 mg of bark standardized for 8 mg of yohimbine. Along with a guaranteed erection 45 minutes after dosage, orgasm was guaranteed as well. although it is difficult to hold back once it is on its' way. I am not trying to be provocative, rather I am providing a factual account of the experience. I do not have a problem obtaining erection, but as I age, my 'recycle time' has increased from every day to every other day. Yohimbe cuts that to every day up to three days in a row, then I need a break.<BR>
I do not recommend more than one capsule of an OTC product. It may speed you up way too much!   <BR>

As for other psychotropic/psychoactive effects, I experienced none. I have not had any side effects yet.
