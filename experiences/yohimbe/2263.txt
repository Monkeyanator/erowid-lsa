Hi there, my name is syris and I will be your guide for tonight. I want to tell you about my Yohimbe Bark experience. If you don't already know, Yohimbe Bark is suppose to be a aphrodisiac that is available at just about any herb shop. Anyways, I bought some early in the week and decided to try it out. I mixed seven heaping teaspoons of it with 1 quart of water. I boiled it for ten minutes and then strained it. I added a glob of honey and then proceded to drink it. It really did not taste that bad, but I would not drink it everyday. After that I went back to my computer and messed around for about 1/2 hour. Then I started to speed up like hell. It was like a mega dose of caffeine. Not pleasant at all. <BR>

So I go to my room and lay down. I can't go to sleep because I am too wired, so I just listen to music for a while. Then an odd thing happened. I got an erection. But this erection was different than other erections in one respect, It would not go away. I was not thinking any sexual thoughts or masturbating. My penis just stayed erect. So this started to hurt a bit because I was wearing shorts... I decided that I had to masturbate this erection away. This is harder than it sounds. For one, my heart is beating pretty fast now and the stress of sex might be too much... but I did it anyways. So I start masturbating and it is starting to get really hard to continue... I keep on thinking I am going to have a heart attack. Finally I reached an orgasm. The orgasm I felt was different than most. It was prolonged. At that time I did not give a flying shit because my heart was beating so hard that the room was turning black. <BR>

I fell to the floor and waited for my heart rate to go down. It eventually did and I went back to bed. I did not sleep at all. I was up the whole night. And I had a constant feeling that I was going to throw up.... In summary, I might do it again at a lower dosage. Maybe... It really was not a pleasant feeling.....
