My friend and I waited till our trip was peaking. We dosed at about 9:00, and at about 2:00, we smoked salvia. Before we smoked, we set up instruments and recording devices, with some difficulty. Once we smoked...what can I say, I've never been so many people at once. I literally felt like at least 3 people. I felt like a walking swizzle stick, as if my bones had become pipe cleaners. My friend attested to the world looking like a Playstation game, that the only thing visible to him were the LEDs of the musical equipment and me, floating above the couch. That's odd, as my hallucinations are never so free, usually they're much more grounded in actual events.<BR>

Anyways, back to the boys galore inside me. One person was playing guitar, another was the me that I am commenting about it now, and a third was watching both of them. My arms looked so alien, and I couldn't relate to them being my own at all. My sense of time felt very strange, I could anticipate the sound of the notes coming out of my guitar before I played them. Later, listening to the tape not-high, I can still attest to that.<BR>

Acid tends to make me scatter brained, and salvia has a similar effect, except the dispersion comes from a select few thoughts. Somehow, the two almost cancelled each other out and I truly did reach a sort of selfless, timeless state. It was exhausting, after about a hour and a half of jamming like that, all we could do was lie back and listen to Olivia Tremor Control's 'Black Foliage' album, which seemed to animate the living room, now in the early hours of the morning.<BR>

Not bad if you want to completely twiddle the knobs of your senses and basically play with the vertical hold of reality.
