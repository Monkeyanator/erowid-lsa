I tried lion's tail, about a joint's worth. The first thing i noticed about 2 mins later was a mild marijuaua like buzz with slight blurry vison. I read other people say they didnt get much from it. i see that as with sorry marijuaua, if not grown right and havested right, it won't be as strong. <BR>
Another thing to note is when leonurus and cannabis are dry they produce the pyschoactive resin to keep themselves from drying out. so i'll put the plant outside in the summer without watering it for awhile then harvest it when its real smelly and sticky.
