I first got this over the counter for a dodgy back, but then the pain went and I decided to try it out clubbing. Its a lot like coming down off E. You dont get any 'rushes' or any kind of high. I found it to be too incapacitating and the next day I could not pass water for 6-7 hours. Maybe it would be helpful as a 'coming down' aid but I can't say I like it. Word of warning: Dont mix with alcohol, apparently it 's not a good idea. I drank approx. 4 pints of lager and took 300mg pills here in Ireland) and basically lost control of my senses. I was disorientated and paranoid and vomited for most of the night. As a painkiller its great and 50mg is enough to slow you down and numb pain (dont drive, you get very sleepy).
