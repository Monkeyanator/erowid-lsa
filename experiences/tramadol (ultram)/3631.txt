Tramadol (tramadol hydrochloride)<BR>
<BR>
A lot of people in my country (Lithuania) enjoy a new drug, easily available in pharmacy stores without any problems. Personally, I don't like it because it produces a kind of state which you can experience on opiates. I am not an opiate fan; I better smoke weed or eat some shrooms. But still, there are several reasons why this drug is so extremely popular here:<BR>
<BR>
1. It is a very cheap way to get high (a pack of 20 pills, containing 50mg of the substance per pill costs only 2$) <BR>
<BR>
2. It can be used (and of course is used) by opiate users as a substituting drug when heroin (also a very popular drug here) is not available. But Tramadol is addictive, I think it is more mentally addictive than physically, personally I know a number of people who can not live a day without this shit.<BR>
<BR>
3. It is legal and sold even for children.<BR>
<BR>
4. People are stupid enough to take it regularly.<BR>

Thats it, thanks for reading.
