A couple of months ago, I was lucky enough to get my hands on a whole scrip of Dexedrine (dextroamphetamine sulfate, d-amphetamine).  <BR>
<BR>
I have taken Dexedrine orally, nasally, and also along with alcohol. <BR>
<BR>
ORALLY:  I find that 10-15mg is about *right* for me.  At this level, I get a nice euphoric buzz and a sense of energy, alertness, & confidence.  More than this and the buzz increases, but my nerves start to get frayed - nervousness, shaking, etc.<BR>
<BR>
NASALLY:  Snorting Dexedrine creates similar effects, but they come on faster, within 5 minutes or so, and create more of a sense of being eerily over-alert/on-edge.  I personally prefer just popping the pills - snorting them just makes me feel too ultra-alert & paranoid. WITH ALCOHOL:  countereffects to a degree the effects of alcohol - while taking Dexedrine, I drink like a fish and become a wide-awake drunk in the process.<BR>
<BR>
On a related note, while I admit not liking snorting Dexedrine, I do like snorting Ritalin - I find it much more euphoric and easier on my constitution - see my Ritalin (methylphenidate) review for more info.<BR>
<BR>
Also, for those of you who want to get down to brass tacks, there was an excellent study done some years ago comparing the *high* produced by various types of speed: d-amphetamine (Dexedrine), methamphetamine (street: Crystal Meth, Ice & pharmaceutical: Desoxyn), ephedrine, phenmetrazine, and methylphenidate (Ritalin). <BR>
Want to know which one gave the 'best' high? ..... Ritalin .....<BR>
So, for those of you with a nearby medical library:<BR>
