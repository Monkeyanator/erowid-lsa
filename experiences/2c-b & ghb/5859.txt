I took 25mg of B's and when it starting coming on, about an hour later, I took 1500mg of GHB.  The GHB softened the whole experience, and increased the intensity (maybe 'activity' is a better word).  It also increased the emotional component of the experience.  In fact, at 3.5 hours into it, there was no indication of coming down.  At about 4 hours it was all over.<BR>

During the experience, I had a lot of open-eyed visuals.  I got into a particularly wonderful inward trance space.  When I wanted to, I could speak intelligently and articulately (perhaps less so in the 3rd hour). When talking, the experience dissipated almost to baseline.  Then with a little relaxation of the mind, it was going full bore again.  Afterwards there was a mild headache (which disappeared with Tylenol) and some disorientation.  A general lack of interest in thinking analytically. After sleeping for about 8 hours (about 2 hours after returning to baseline), the rest of the afternoon was quite pleasant.
