I recently went to Amsterdam with the sole intention of getting mashed. On the first day, me and my five friends went to a smartshop and brought a bag each of mexican cubensis mushrooms. We all decided because we were all tired from having no sleep in 48 hours,that we would do them another day. <BR>
<BR>
However after I had been smoking weed from ten in the morning, I was very stoned and we were in are room, and most people had fallen asleep. The only people still awake was me and my friend Pete. I had never taken mushrooms before, so I opened the  packet to have look at them. As soon as I looked at them I put the two mushrooms in my mouth and chewed them and swallowed them.<BR>
<BR>
It was about 40 minutes later and I started to make a spliff, as I was crumbling the weed into the papers, I noticed that I had started feeling really strange. It seemed like it took ages to roll the spliff, and once it was rolled, everything felt weird. I was trying to explain to Pete what was going on in my head, but I was making no sense. I began smoking the spliff I rolled, it had about five different weeds in and no tobbaco. Every time I had a toke and blew the smoke out. An amazing feeling swept across my brain, it felt like pure holiness sweeping across my brain.<BR>
<BR>
After smoking half the spiff I had completely come up. The curtains covering the wall were moving like the sea, i was staring at them for ages, and stared thinking about the buzz. I kept thinking that the mushrooms were controlling me, because all I was, was an animal, and that they thought I was no better or worse than any other creature on the planet. Every muscle in my body felt completely relaxed, I could feel the buzz in my head flowing around my body. I looked behind and I was shocked to see all my friends in bed, because it felt like everything I was seeing was the whole universe. As I forgot that they even existed. <BR>
<BR>
After about 3 hours tripping I went to bed, but I could not sleep it felt like my brain was too powerful. I was laying down with my eyes closed, and pete was doing bongs, the souud of the water bubbling, sounded almost painfully loud, and every noise pete was making also sounded amplified. I stated shouting to myself with every noise pete made until i opened my eyes.<BR>
<BR>
It felt like a dream, I was feeling the things around me, but I could not actually feel them, it felt like they were not there. I was very disorientated at this point. So tried getting back to sleep. I was lying down and I had loads of energy, so much that until I fell asleep, I was constantly twitching all over my body.<BR>
<BR>
That night felt like the best of my life and I can not wait to do them again.
