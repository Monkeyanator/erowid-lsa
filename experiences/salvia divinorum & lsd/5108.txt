This was the most incredible experience of my life:<BR>
<BR>
Contoured in asymmetrical formation, <BR>
The film of skin flimsy and unyielding <BR>
Separate from these opulent pastures <BR>
(the hum of refrigerators distort and disable <BR>
as the static materializes to voices) <BR>
this is the lingual resurge of our predestined <BR>
transparent obfussed reality <BR>
on an ostrological plane. <BR>
<BR>
And though it is my back that is swollen, <BR>
From carrying the future of your peoples <BR>
Your realities and their offspring <BR>
Come merging at the gallows, <BR>
Their tenses are moldy shadows <BR>
By the film that is flimsy and unyielding. <BR>
Underground, my mind is a roadmap, <BR>
to a resting place where we gather <BR>
At once the chaotic crux beheld. <BR>
<BR>
They tell me that my life is a conception <BR>
Of urging galactic bodies <BR>
And finally I understand what it all <BR>
But in all life. (means) <BR>
I am to live as there, on another plane (forever) <BR>
In a tangent representation, segmenting the sun in shards <BR>
(my mind calculates like a prism) <BR>
An obscure arrangement of beings, <BR>
Those around me at last unmasked <BR>
From their manipulation of <BR>
a clumsy walking, multi-complex <BR>
mucus membrane <BR>
socializing apparatus; <BR>
for that is what it is to be human. <BR>
<BR>
This world is made of molten, <BR>
And fuzzbox phrasings between two planets <BR>
Have subtextual longings that divide them. <BR>
To complete the unspoken disparity, <BR>
My voice falters. <BR>
Perhaps if unlocked from our unity, <BR>
Spacewind and dustrocks are collecting, <BR>
Like grass all mildewed with <BR>
Purple glowing sublingual matter <BR>
and each blade spaded and grueling, <BR>
The spiral galaxies of <BR>
Indeterminable number, <BR>
come floating on by the moor. <BR>
Compressed and contoured <BR>
The multihued island, <BR>
Where language is born. <BR>
<BR>
If the once-solid ice that surrounds an island <BR>
(the island where all souls rest) <BR>
then please remove the bugs from my ashes, <BR>
(like monkeys, like monkeys) <BR>
Each concept is slowly windswept, <BR>
And the dreams of an age relive. <BR>
To be born again is not careless, <BR>
I can escape this world whenever it pleases. <BR>
<BR>
My self-referentiality is injured; <BR>
Hyperlinks scattered on the carpet, <BR>
if we, as monkeys are able <BR>
to iterate our every desire. <BR>
yet still we look to the heavens for guidance, <BR>
<BR>
Then pulsating for what seemed like centuries, <BR>
would the sentating spiral galaxies recede <BR>
and a new state of being reveals itself? <BR>
The digital island that materialized <BR>
Is every moment we waited for <BR>
And what could only inevitably come. <BR>
Release from all that is sacred, <BR>
Give birth to the meaning. <BR>
<BR>
Imploding clouds surround me, <BR>
My mind splits like an atom <BR>
When worlds merge, there is oscillation <BR>
And were just its episodic vibrations, <BR>
Phasing between man, ape, and microorganism <BR>
The formality of actually occurring, <BR>
My body lilted and transparent <BR>
I float away in a mess of words <BR>
My entire sentence, sedated.
