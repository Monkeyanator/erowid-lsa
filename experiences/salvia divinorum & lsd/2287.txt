As I was enjoying my nice trip off some LSD a friend brought back from a Phish concert, I suddenly recalled my friend reminding me earlier to try smoking some salvia while I'm triping.  So, while I was chillin watching the TV I decided to take a nice sized bong hit of salvia.  I held the smoke. When I exhaled I looked down to see and feel as if my body was rearranged.  I could see and feel my leg attached to my elbow and my head was suddenly on the end of my foot as I looked horizontally and almost upside down at the bong I just toked.  My body was completely deformed.  I felt as if I was a three dimensional solid play toy.  I looked at the TV having a crazy conversation with the man on TV.  I've  experienced alot of shit with hallucinagens, but this was fucking incredible.  I was alone the whole time.  I suggest you try taking it one hit at a time and give it about 30 seconds till you're stuck for twenty to thirty mins feeling things you've never experienced.  I don't think there are any ways to get that feeling with-out using that combo.  This is definently something you have to try if you think your an experianced tripper.  It'll put you in your place real quick.  I didn't get any fear, I guess because I used dried  leaves which aren't as potent as extract.  All I can say is incredible!
