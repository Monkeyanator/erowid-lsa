This was my second experience with amanita's. On the first I took 6 grams and had a threshold level, so i decided to double that dose. <BR>
<BR>
T+0 hours: me and J take around 12 grams of dried yellow fly's...<BR>
<BR>
T+1/2 hour: start to feel something coming on, a little nausea too...decide smoking weed will be a good idea...it calms the nausea and makes the trip start in quicker...<BR>
<BR>
T+1 hour: start to feel fucked up....up close everything is normal, but at a far it is a blur...lights are messing with me....nausea is still bad...<BR>
<BR>
T+2 hours: Tripping very very hard right now....J is having a hard time....this is very very intense...J's sober friends are making shit too negative and making things worse...<BR>
<BR>
T+2 1/2 hours: take J home...she is having a very very difficult time...she didn't expect to be this fucked up, neither did I...I some how drive home....Objects don't have the motion LSD gives them, but the light is very distorted and makes everything else distorted around them.<BR>
<BR>
T+3 hours:  lay down...I am salivating very bad...sweating and the chills....i have taken very high levels of LSD, 2CT7, and foxy, but this is overwhelming me...<BR>
<BR>
T+3 1/2 hours: it is so intense that either I made myself pass out or my body just shut down, but i woke up into consiouness 8 hours after taking the yellow fly's and was still at a +1 or +2....i then went back to bed....This was a very very overwhelming experience....I got these from the same indiana company most get them at....if you are taking the yellow's, do not take more than 10 grams....this stuff is for real...
