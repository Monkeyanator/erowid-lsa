Having had mushrooms lose their luster on me from heavy use the past two autumn seasons, and not finding DXM to be very 'magically inspiring' I decided to do a double psychedelic experience for the first time.<BR>
<BR>
I prepared mentally as I normally would, making sure I had no business to attend to the following day, and that my parents were safely tucked away for the night in their beds.  <BR>
<BR>
The mushrooms were prepared as heavily a concentrated dose as I could obtain having only 3 caps on hand.  I have found that higher concentration levels in the tea works better, in my opinion.  <BR>
<BR>
I popped six 30 mg. DXM tablets and 4 mg. antihistimines before preparing the brew, because it takes longer for it to take effect.  30 minutes after drinking the brew I could feel the two drugs coinciding.  It was as if my mind was an ocean and a powerful storm was taking place, with waves splashing around everywhere.<BR>
<BR>
I sat for some time just staring at the t.v. in amazement.  Then, the antihistimes told me I wanted to try to rest.  I lay down in the bed with my eyes closed, when something came over me. I quickly opened my eyes, and when I viewed the clock, I felt as though another being had taken my place in my body.  I bolted from the bed and turned the music on my computer, 5 minutes later I again stared in astonishment at my t.v.  5 more minutes passed and I wanted to lay down again.  This activity went on for quite some time, until my urinary tract came into play. <BR>
<BR>
I made a blind man's attempt at finding the bathroom in a strange house, I finally made it.  Sweet relief, what beatiful patterns my bathroom has.  <BR>
<BR>
Lights off!  From my bathroom to my room was darkness, and all of a sudden I saw an image from my childhood screaming at me in the hall.  'LOOK WHAT YOU'VE DONE!'  It said.  And I knew exactly what it was.  Back in my room I returned to the regularly scheduled program of t.v., bed, and music.  All the while repeating in my head,'the same thing over and over.'  <BR>
<BR>
Some time later my mind reached a longer version of the same sentence,'the same thing over and over but in reverse.'  I didn't at this point know what it meant.  Venturing outside for a nice change of scenery one of lifes hidden secrets revealed itself to me ,'The same thing over and over but in reverse is sex.'  This insane route of thinking continued until the mushrooms wore off.  And myself being an insomniac I drank a few beers until I could finally drift off into harmonious peace.<BR>
<BR>
I saw that night what the final thought in my mind meant, can you decipher it for yourself?
