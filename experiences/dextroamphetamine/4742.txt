I had taken Dexies before (orally) and really thought they were great. Then me and my friend decided to find a way to get the buffer off the little balls inside the capsule.  We finally just crushed them and chopped them w/ a razor.  20mg lines are the best, as 10 dosen't hit the spot, and 30mg is hard to do.  These damn little things make bigger lines than imaginable looking at the capsule itself.  <br>

We were awake and jacked for 5 hours shy of 4 whole days.  A good tip is to get some reses cups or whatever you can force down, and you will have more energy and feel alot better.  And remember to drink water!  <br>

As an added note, the sleep dep didn't bother me at all, I really enjoyed seeing the speed deamons this time, but a couple times completely forgot where and what I was doing (after 3rd day).  Just thought I'd share this, because not many people think that Dexadrine can be snorted.
