i used this substance early in the new year as part of an attempt to redirect my not inconsiderable talents towards a more productive and spiritual path.<BR>
<BR>
The effects were apparent 15-25 minutes after ingestion of the brew. I had some warnings about bowel tension and decided to eat a fair amount of peppermint after ingestion....... unfortunately i did not escape the wrath of mandrake and rode 'the bus' for a very uncomfortable 45 minutes before expelling a noxious and unproductive fart of some volume.<BR>
<BR>
However, 1-2 hrs after this i had an incredible dream/hallucination involving the shadows cast by a violent storm outside. this is by far one of the most frightening and subtle drugs i have used... the only metaphor i can think of is that it is like an absolute opposite to morning glory tinctures which i often use in very small doses as a preparation for significant rituals.<BR>

If you are of celtic descent and interested in the darker side of your past i thoroughly recommend this substance .... with extreme caution.
