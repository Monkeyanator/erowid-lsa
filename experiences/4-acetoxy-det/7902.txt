Shortly after taking the 20 mg orally, I noticed the so typical 'tryptamine high effect'. It felt just like 4-Acetoxy-DiPT or foxy methoxy. The effects were pretty much the same as with psilocybin. Brighter colours, concentration was poor, thoughts turned into visions and so on. It felt like it lasterd longer than what 4-Acetoxy-DiPT does and wasn't as smooth and mellow. A small amount of nasty muscle tension, but no nausea was present most of the time.
