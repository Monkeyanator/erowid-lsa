Me and my friends a and k had planned on going to a party all messed up on shrooms.  We figured that we could each consume an 1/8th and still be aware of the natural world, we were wrong.<BR>
<BR>
We sat at my house and each consumed an 1/8th then k started to drive us to the party. Half way through the drive k and i looked at each other and asked if we had remember to bring a.  The shrooms had taken effect and we were just starting to notice.  A shadow had been cover up a in the back seat. So we both look back and dont see him.  We look at each other and decide to turn around.  As we start to stop he giggles, and says the winshield was melting.  Not even realizing that we were stopped we all look at each other and say in harmony what do we do?  Figuring out that we dont need to turn around we proceed towards the party again. Now let me tell you, riding in a car with a melting winshield is not exactly the best thing in the world. K had finally got us to the party and got out.  I was gettin out then a told me to make sure that there was no one outside. So i look around and say its clear and for him to come on.. . He looks out and says NO make sure no one is out there. Now for some reason it got to me and i was lookin around like hurry up there aint no one out here.  I tell him that no one is out here and to hurry up. <BR>

As he is gettin out i see k run down the stairs and straight into the woods. A gets out and runs in the woods, and i follow. I never found out why we all ran in the woods but i remember walking around trying to find reality. Me and a would knock on trees asking if reality was there. I dont remember where we went or what we did the rest of the night, i just know that it was the wierdest thing i have ever expreinced ever.
