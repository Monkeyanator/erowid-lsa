I started by taking 10 small mushies and boiling the shit out of them in water, sqeezing them and boiling them some more (cos I'm a hygeine freak and we picked them a couple of nights earlier in a friend's paddock). I discarded them soggy mushrooms (perhaps a waste, but I had a good supply). I added drinking chocolate to the brown liquid and drank it from a cup as I settled into bed on that warm Sunday - It tasted good! (I was feeling good, we had rocked the crowd at a show last night). I expect this would be half the dose required to fully trip for me.<BR>

In the first hour the only effects I noticed were a slight pinkening of light and elevated mood. About 2 hours into it I felt as though the windows were merely projecting images - as the birds reeled in the sky they flowed together with squid - like motion, the giant gum trees thrashing in the wind were awe inspiring. About half an hour later, vague forms started to take shape - I had a very vague vision of a beautiful woman in the pink clouds, cradling a baby in ther arms. I felt this would be my future wife and first child. I was blissing out, but for some reason I felt like I should stay focused and on the lookout for teachings. <BR>

Around the third hour I became very aware of the pendants around my neck - one a greenstone given to me by my mother and the other a bone carving from my twin sister. I felt their support and was close to tears with joy. I raised my hands and they pulsed with a primal, animal energy. I wanted to explore this further so I went to the mirror and looked at myself. It felt like a warrior, and my physical form made more sense, as if I was receiving abstract instructions on how to use it more naturally. I went out and looked at my land - a beautiful valley threatened my developments surrounding it. I felt very protective, and suddenly a felt like I was a huge being with biblical - sized wings, which I was stretching out over my domain, protecting it. I feel that this was a glimpse of my true self, or spirit, or something like that - I don't really know.<BR>
<BR>
On the comedown I composed some beautiful beats that sounded like angels singing with perfect, powerful clarity - just for me.  I can't wait for next season!<BR>
