How to explain this..... well here it is:<BR>
<BR>
I took X 10-15 times so far. each time i do it, i trip on something new except glow stix, those are always interesting to me). The first time it was all about lasers. after that i went deeper - touching, sounds (music, sounds around me, people talking,etc.), i went exploring beats and voices. I could listen to a song and separate each single sound it's made of. But last time i went raving, I had it all together. whatta feelin'. An incredible laser show, along with an awesome combination of disco lights, strobe lights, and fog. DJ playing some great beats. I had my best friends with me, massaging me, tripping me out with all kinds of lights. <BR>

To make the long story short:<BR>
When I had my eyes closed i felt the music. I was the music. my friends were music. I loved music. With my eyes open, i loved my friends and even people around me i didn't even know. i loved the way everybody danced and how friendly everybody was. There were times when i would listen to music sitting down, and just go into a trance kinda feeling, and then when i snap out of it i would think just how much i love LIFE and X!! it's all about love. I felt like the whole place was one big love machine. it's ALL about love.
