I am fairly experienced with e, but this was a particularly enlightening roll.  I was at a three day rock festival with a group of friends.  It was quite enjoyable...very bohemian--no electricty, minimal plumbing, and best of all, no family matters to worry about.  A couple of people in our group had been rolling non-stop for the entirety of our stay.  I had been trying to get my own, but alas, it seemed to no avail. On the third night, I began talking to people at the neighboring campsite and found they had a few buddhas to sell.  Joy!  <BR>
<BR>
I took the roll at about 11:45 pm, the same time as my boyfriend.  I started rolling about 30 minutes later and just kicked back beside the campfire.  I ran my hands through the dewey grass and was in heaven!  I was a little upset, however, because my boyfriend (who had gotten his roll elsewhere) wasn't feeling the effects after 3 hours.  <BR>
<BR>
At about 4:45 am, I began to get chilly (the fire had long since died out) and went into our camper.  My boyfriend followed, as he was still not rolling, and had given up on it.  We laid down on the mattress together and just cuddled.  It was incredible!  (Now I should preface this next part by explaining that I'm of a pagan religion.  I believe that I have spirit guides.  I had long been searching for my spirit guides through meditation, but none were specifically clear to me.)  As I lay in the sleeping bag next to my boyfriend, I let my vision wander to the window of the motor home.  I saw great big butterflies in all shades of mauve, pink, and purple.  I started giggling around the pacifier that was planted firmly in my mouth.  I then looked at my boyfriend (who after 5 hours, had finally started rolling) and smiled and touched his cheek.  I then looked down at my pillow case (blue in color) and saw an ocean with dolphins playing and leaping.  At this point, I heard a whisper say to me 'Your free spirit is much like that of the dolphin.  Take it's nature and incorporate it with your own.'  <BR>
<BR>
I've never cried while on e, but this was an incredibly moving experience.  My boyfriend looked at me and asked if something was wrong.  I just shook my head and smiled (around the pacifier) at him and gave him a huge hug.<BR>

I now have a necklace with a dolphin pendant that I wear when I feel tied down by things (school, stress...whatever), and when I touch it, I feel the same warm fuzzies I got from the e that night.
