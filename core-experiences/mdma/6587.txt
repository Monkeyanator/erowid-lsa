Hey my name is alex.  Im only 17 yrs old and i started takeing Ecstacy about 6 months ago.  Im the kind of guy that likes to have as much fun as possible when i go to a club so ecstacy was my ticket to a great time.  I started by just taking 2 pills per trip maybe about 1 trip every 2 weeks or so.  My E trip was always great and long lasting for about 6-7 hrs on only 2 pills! i was doing that for maybe about 3 months before i started to really get into it. <BR>

I began taking around 4-5 pills per trip, tripping 2-3 times a week! and the sad thing was that i was mostly doing it at home, by myself, on my free time.  I always enjoyed just dropping and chilling out in my room and just admiring everything and thinking about people.  I just loved tripping! i still do but heres my problem.  I now take 10-12 pills per trip, taking 2-3 pills at once every 2 hrs.  Thats pretty bad.  I feel like my brain is totally gone. Im suprised that im not a complete moron by now.  I entered myself into rehab because i didnt want to overdose on the stuff.  I dont know anyone that drops as much and as often as i do.  after the first 3 pills i take i dont even feel anything! my heart doesnt even pump that much faster than it ususally does.  I think that my heart had adapted to the amphetamine in the E.  Im so afraid that i will overdose some day because the E doesnt even work anymore.  I find that im not depressed, but its alot easier to get angry or sad.  It is defanetly alot more easy to cry about something.  To sum up, i feel that this great drug is too great for anyone and can easily be abused because its just too damn good!
