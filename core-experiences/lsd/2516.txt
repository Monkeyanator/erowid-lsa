So there's this thing that came through my town called the Omegafest and my friend buys several bottles of the pure liquid that allegedly starts the national chain of illicit lysergic acid.<BR>
<BR>
This stuff is so strong and pure that I fill a by-then almost empty food-coloring bottle with tap water and swish and gulp... Blugh! I've never really tasted acid to such an immeasurable degree, and I soon discover that despite my self-proclaimed guru status I have never dosed like this before.<BR>
<BR>
So we're (my friend and I) winding back to our origin of consciousness and we're discussing trip stuff. After awhile I realize that my consciousness is completely delocalized and quantum reality is surging through my brain. I have to think really, really hard to figure out what room I am in and by midnight I have forgotten everything that I had done earlier that day.<BR>
<BR>
This is where it gets weird... I come to discover that me and my friend are of the same genetically evolved species, except I'm the active component and he's the passive component. He had mastered the trip from the past up the the present and I knew the trip from the present into the future. Anyways we finally succeed in smoking pot and I am suddenly absorbed in what I swore was post-terrestrial existence.<BR>
<BR>
Everything I saw moved in ray-traced slow motion and all light appeared to be pixellized. This is where the missing moment begins. We are walking in perfect circles in his apartment living room speaking back and forth to each other without thinking about it at all, utilizing the vehicle of our heightened consciousness to communicate. Then, I bump into a chair and it fucks with my orbit. I obliviously pick the chair up and heave it as if it was the oppressive force I've experienced my entire subjective existence... right through a gigantic sliding glass door.<BR>
<BR>
My friend looks at me astonished, but I assuage his anxiety by proclaiming 'Hey man! It doesn't matter anymore! We're creating everything we perceive with our minds and now you and I are going to infuse our thoughts and make the universe contract into the big stop! Finally! We're god now!'<BR>
<BR>
How incredibly naive. We proceeded to break a lot of other things in his home, spit on the walls, pour beer everywhere, unleash gigantic bags of tea into the air, and cover all of the walls with psychotic gibberish in crayon. Actually, I only broke the glass door with the chair and my friend did all of the other stuff while I lay in the bottom of his shower... water blasting, curled up naked in a fetal position sucking my thumb. A baby once again...<BR>
<BR>
My subjective cognitive reference point had completely vanished and I was thrown back into infinity... Simultaneously existing in a 3d shell with my mind expanded into the entirety of the fouth dimension. Mentally dead but physically alive. I was still waiting for us to somehow shed our old skins and enter 'thought-world' but I started coming down instead.<BR>
<BR>
I realized that I was not, in fact, existing in a place made by my thoughts so that I could unify all things into one, but that I had just tripped harder than I've ever tripped on LSD and that now I would have to pay for the shit I broke. Kinda bummed me out that I had tripped once again only to put more polish on the paradigm and not to cross myself over into a greater form, whatever that might have been.
