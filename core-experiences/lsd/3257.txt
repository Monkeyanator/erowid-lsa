My then-boyfriend and I decided to do acid one summer evening.  He had done it many times before, and I had done it just a couple of times.  We dropped about 4 hits of liquid onto sugar cubes and ate them at about 5pm.  The come-on was rather quick - at about 5:30 I watched the shingles on the neighbor's roof melting.  And it all went quickly downhill from there.<BR>

It was probably about 5:45 when we went onto the roof of our building to see the view.  I got scared up there and tried to come back into the apartment (we lived on the top floor), but got 'lost' and couldn't figure out what apartment was ours.  I finally got inside and became even more confused.  Here I started losing touch with reality.  I went into the bathroom and saw a new package of toilet paper.  I remembered buying it, but I knew there was no way I could have bought it in my current state, so I surmised that I didn't always feel this way.  About the same time, I remembered that I had started a new job the week before and I knew I couldn't work feeling like this, so I must sometimes feel differently than this, but how?  I asked my boyfriend what was wrong with me?  Had we taken drugs?  He said yes.  I really wanted him to sit with me then, but he was tripping so hard that we couldn't communicate.  I went and sat on the couch and thought, 'If I can go to sleep, I'll feel better when I wake up.'  I was *really* scared; I couldn't remember what my life was like - all I knew about was reality as it existed for me at that particular moment, and it was not pleasant.  I just wanted it to stop.<BR>

I have a vague memory of taking a shower; I assume this was at the beginning of the trip.  I know I threw up somewhere in this first hour, but I don't remember getting sick - I just remember cleaning it up later that night.  I was told that at one point I collapsed on the living room floor, but I don't remeber that either.  Other than that, I came to in my bed about 10pm.  I have no idea how I got there or what I was doing for the previous four hours.  From that time on it was like a 'normal' acid trip.<BR>
<BR>
Because I was so scared and so far gone, it was a full three years before I ever did drugs again.  (I have since candyflipped twice and had great experiences.)<BR>

The moral of the story is: Don't take acid for granted, and Err on the side of under-dosing.
