I took 8 doses w/ sum friends and my now ex-girlfriend, I weighed about 115 pounds than, I am 5'11, so I am a bean pole.  I had taken 7 doses two times before this nite, and sadly I recall being dosed more than 8 times, but everyone is too fucked up to remember. I remember our friend who dropped me going 1,2,3,3,4,5,6,6,6,7,8 rofl.... so who the fuck knows, anyways...<BR>

It was all good until the cops showed up to bust the out door rave I was at, and I was tripn bout having my half zip of bomb on me etc.  Also when we got to the car 3 cop cars happened to be parked right infront of it.  Anyways, everyone in the car was on 8 doses or more, and the driver could no longer drive so she pulls over after we get far enuff from the party in a gas station, luckily someone I knew drove passed and recognized our car.  They gladly offered to drive, and we headed for another party.  My friend likes bass, and the bronco had a phat sound system including a box w/ 2 10's.... so Im sitting in the back, needing to take a piss with mad bass and I all of a sudden start seeing random ass cop faces, and morbid ass shit all around me, now I have never seen anything like that usually trails, colors, and grid patterns.  <BR>
<BR>
So I started to feel really insecure, we get to the party and he tells us we have pay to get in.. so were like uh wtf we need to save our money...  he also informs me that he wants to borrow the money for him and his girl to get in, well I had the money, but it wasnt mine it was my girls, and she was too fucked up to realize so I got him and his girl getting all crazy w/ me about the money and Im like this shit aint even mine.  At this point I was way gone.... we get home, and I lay in my bed... I remember certain flashes of what happened the next 5 hours, but I really only remember almost waking up out of a dream, only to find my girl and everyone else gone....everything starts hitting me, I had fucking wigged out hardc0re on my girl, and not even realized what I was doing.  <BR>

I am a true believer that LSD can change me as a person my morals, goals, and asperations may no longer mean a damn thing.  I have seen it happen, what I need to remember drugs r fun, but I need to keep it at a level, and not fuck w/ doses too much, this is coming from someone who fried like everyweekend for a summer.  I will tell you it changed me, yeh it opened my mind up to alot of things but it also closed some doors for me.
