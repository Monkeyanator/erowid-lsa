Wow, first acid trip in 8 months. This dude I know from on the<BR>
Internet sent me two hits of Red Sun acid, and I took them both. It hit me<BR>
fast, in about a half hour, and it hit me hard. I played guitar and talked<BR>
on the Internet for about 2 hours.<BR>
<BR>
        It was an interesting trip. It hit me a little around midnight of<BR>
the 20th. I took a hit of pot right at midnight to celebrate the first<BR>
minute of the first day of spring, and that kicked in the acid. Around<BR>
1:45 things were real intense so I decided to get off the computer and go<BR>
lay down in bed. The near-full moon was very bright and shining in my<BR>
window, with clouds swirling unnaturally fast around it. The bars of my<BR>
window frame were flickering around, and the still bare tree branches<BR>
outside were dancing wit their own life. It was very visual, and too<BR>
intense to look at for long, so I pulled down the shade and closed my<BR>
eyes, and went to that inner, chaotic, cut and paste universe of vivid<BR>
imagery that I hadn't been to in years. Cartoony voices seemed to be<BR>
saying nonsense words from every direction as I floated there in<BR>
hyperspace, saying things like 'Zlerty-zot meep awwww znew' or 'Sbpack<BR>
Sbpack.' After a while, the chaos organized somewhat, becoming a jumbled<BR>
collection of imagery and themes that seemed to come from Jewish culture.<BR>
Flash to images of a baby in a crip, this feels something like a memory.<BR>
This gives way to images of people I know now, only I see them as they<BR>
would have been as small children. Eventually things spiral down to more<BR>
coherent imagery, and I lay in bed thinking about life until around 4:30<BR>
when I managed to fall asleep.<BR>
<BR>
        I haven't tripped like that in years.
