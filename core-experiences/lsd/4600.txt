The day started off as any normal day.  I got up and knew before hand that I would drop acid this day.  I had recently made a decision to stop smoking weed, and I thought a little LSD would give the introspection I needed to understand why I had to stop smoking.  <BR>
  <BR>
12:30: After calling the supplier met up with him in town.  The supplier was with a friend and she showed me what they had.  She was cutiing the pieces with some scissors.  She handed me two little pieces that were about the size of 2/3 of a normal tab.  I asked her if she was serious and she then told me that they had intended to buy a vial, but instead the guy soaked up all the acid from inside where it was made onto three pieces of paper.  Having known her a while, I believed her and went home.<BR>
  <BR>
1:00: I decide to go on a hike up a creek by my house.  It would take  me to the top of a hill which I thought would be fun to look at. I dropped both hits and started walking.  I had a video camera, two Red Bulls, and a mind starting to expand.<BR>
  <BR>
1:45: Drink one Red Bull,resume hiking.  I'm getting the pre-trip feeling.  Hope Red Bull will help me out.  <BR>
  <BR>
2:30: Acid had taken over.  I am on an outlook on top of the hill.  I watch the town below undulate and contort.  The distant clouds look like I could touch them if I wanted. Pulled out video camera and started to film.  <BR>
  <BR>
3:15: I'm at top of hill.  If I dont concentraight on my thoughts they will wander off on tangents.  I start to get paranoid that I was in Mountain Lion teritory and if one was to get me, no one would know.  I start back home.<BR>
  <BR>
3:45: Before going home I sit on a rock and meditate on things, in general.  Then I go home.  No one is there so I'm cool.  I watch Dark City and it blows my mind.  I relate it to everyday life.  I get lost in it and when it is over I feel sad.  Now the hallucinations are everywhere and I feel like I'm in a kaleidescope.  I turn on VH1 and watch the 100 greatest Rock and Roll Artists.  I have a paranoid thought that maybe all old 70's bands did acid and got to the same level of tripping as I am in right now.  I start to appreciate all the artists I see and other things about them.<BR>
  <BR>
4:45: Totally lost now, this stuff took me over.  Every thought I have turns into a vison. I ponder running to the beach, which is foutyr miles away.  Seriouslly.  Sanity comes back and I meelow out.  Start having real visions.  Like being in a dream while awake.  <BR>
  <BR>
6:45: Mellow now.  Hallucinations have stopped.  Stll freaked out about the visions.  Am in awe the rest of the day.<BR>
<BR>
The moral of this story is NEVER UNDERESTIMATE THE POWER OF LSD.  Once you do your fucked.  If i had been in public, I would have been arrested.  I totally lost contact with reality for about an hour.  Now, I am going to stay away from LSD.  To all you new, eager acid heads out there, beware.  What I thought was a joke of a dose turned into the most powerfull trip of my life.
