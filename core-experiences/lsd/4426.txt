I love Acid. I love it, but not as much as I love life.<BR>
<BR>
I will never take acid again. My 10th experience with it was so disillusioning, that I am now considering doing no drugs other than those I have already tried and have not had bad experiences with,  specifically alcohol, marijuana, mushrooms, and codeine.  (I have tried a 'White Buddha' pill of Ecstacy, which I liked, but it was not anything like my friends described rolling to be.) <BR>
<BR>
Acid is a wonderful drug; however, it is also a BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD drug.<BR>
<BR>
One night at college a few months ago there was an 'Acid Jazz' show at the Student Union.  It was free, and there was a keg in the loft.  The music was ludicrously good--just drums, bass, and guitar in moving modes and harmonies like I have rarely heard before.  Soon after entering, I saw my friend G buying something.  I approached him and said what's up to G and asked the dude what he was selling.  He told me it was pure MDMA.  (Which, by the way, is one of the biggest drug shams since 'triple-dipped' acid.  Unless you get a testing kit, you don't know what in God's name is in there.)  At the time I wasn't really interested in spending $20 on a good time, so I said 'No, thanks.  I'm all set on that.'  I obtained a 32 oz. cup for the keg, waited in line, sat down in the balcony and started groovin' to the tunes.  We started smoking some bowls of dank, and soon my friend A asked us if we wanted some acid.  G got some, and I asked how much it was.  He said it was free.  I said 'Well, shit.  Gimme two hits.' (I like to test out a batch of cid before I start indulging.  I'm sure glad I did that time.)<BR>
<BR>
We started smoking some bowls again, and about a half an hour later, I started feeling it.  I told G he better stop drinking because with Ecstacy, you never know what's in there to interact with Alchohol.  I was starting to feel pretty fucked up, and I was starting to hallucinate, so I threw away my beer as well.  It was about half full, so I had drunk about a pint.  Within 45 minutes of intake, I was tripping--this was some good acid.<BR>
<BR>
The music was pulsating, and I could actually see the vibrations in the air, and the strife between the competing harmonies.  Several times I went to the bathroom to get some water.  On the way one of the times I saw A, and gave him the thumbs up.  He said, 'Do you need more?'  I said,  'You have MORE?'  He said, 'You feeling good?'  I said 'Holy Shit, this is great stuff.'  He said, 'That's good, I want people to remember this night.'  I sure do.<BR>
<BR>
The rest of the night was kinda spotty in my memory.  I remember people throwing playdoh around--that was funny--and I remember intermission.  I thought it was over.  I said, 'I can't believe it's over, they were so good!'  My friend E said, 'It's not over, it's just intermission,' and I said, 'Oh thank God!'  That's the last thing I remember.<BR>
<BR>
I woke up in the hospital with a woman leaning over me.  I could feel something in my throat and a pain in my penis.  I went to feel my dick, and the woman said, 'You're in the hospital, you had a seizure...You're in the intensive care unit, you have a catheter in your penis.'  I said, 'Aaaagggghhhhuuuuuhhhhhhhuuuuggguuhhhh,' and i tried to tear this weird tube out of my throat.<BR>
<BR>
Apparently, my roomate had found me lying in my bed in my dorm room having a violent seizure, foaming and bleeding from the mouth.  He called 911.  I was lucky.  Apparently, I wasn't breathing and had a very low heart rate.  They had to intubate me.  I was five minutes away from death, and a flip of a coin away from sreious brain damage, paralysis, or being a vegetable.<BR>
<BR>
I was terribly sore for days--I could barely walk.  My lip was also torn up.  Soon, I had to undergo counseling, treatment, and drug tests.  Eventually I was sent home on involuntary medical leave for missing and failing to prouduce urine at a few drug screens.  I am now clean of all substances, including marijuana (my drug of choice), and am preparing to return to school for the spring semester.<BR>
<BR>
Many of my friends at school did not believe what had happened to me.  Some of the upperclassmen told me, 'you can't die from acid, that guy probably gave you bleach,' and I now realize what myths there are surrounding acid.  I have no history of epilepsy, and I know this is not an uncommon thing because it later happened to one of my friends from a different batch.  My friend G also took 12 hits of the same acid, drank, smoked pot, and had taken ecstacy that night and he was fine.  It was great acid, if not some of the best i've ever had; however, you still take chances even among the best and completely unadulterated of acids.  While I love tripping, and see it as an enormous part of my spiritual life, and am glad that what happened happened so that i do not do acid again and kill myself, I do not wish what happened to me upon any other soul, for it was a truly terrifying experience.
