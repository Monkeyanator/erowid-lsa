I bought two 118 mL bottles of Robitussin Maximum Strength Cough.  Each bottle contained 354 mg of DXM.  Came home.  Cleaned up me and the room. I was preparing for a spiritual trip.  i had meditated and all.  I downed both bottles for a total of 708mg of DXM.  I popped the 'Two Pages' cd into the player, laid back and relaxed. I was expecting a spiritual psychedelic trip. It was far from that.  .  90 minutes after ingestion i had the feeling nearly identical to snorting a few lines of ketamine.  The experience lasted a good 8 hours.  <BR>

I began spinning records, Olatunji, The Last Poets, Donny Hathaway, then i tried some classic drum n bass, then house. but i found it to be annoying to do any type of movement, as with K.  The effects were strong, and i couldnt have driven or gone about my business.  So i chose to lay back in darkness and let my mind run free.  The mind trip, on a scale of 1 to 10 was a 3.  it wasnt very crisp or clear and there was little insight, just a restatement of the known. I wont use DXM again as I didnt enjoy the experience.  It was just a serious waste of time in my opinion.  In my opinion DXM is slightly psychedelic and mostly dissociative.  It's similar to K but lasts for hours.
