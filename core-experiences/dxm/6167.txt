DXM is the most powerful, profound and scary drug I have ever done. It is definitely not for the faint of heart or weak of mind. I've learned to take responsibility for my indulgences, and I was prepared to take responsibility for that night.<BR>
<BR>
But I didn't expect this.<BR>
<BR>
I researched DXM trips for awhile before making my first batch using the 'Agent Lemon' method. It's cheap, the ingredients are easy to find, and most importantly, the theory and procedure were very simple after some experience in the Organic Chem. lab. On our first trip we split a weak batch of 1,000 mg four ways. We thought a tiny taste should suffice our first time (to test the safety of my extraction). We experienced mild disassociation and didn't die... so we decided to take the plunge the following weekend.  <BR>
<BR>
I produced 2/3 gallon of extra pure 'DXemonade' (mixed with lemon juice) using 6 8oz bottles of Tussin Maximum Strength (700 mg/bottle w/no other actives). I was very careful to liberally estimate my percent yield, to help avoid an overdose when pouring out our portions. On Saturday evening, we had 6 doses of 550-650 mg each (concentrated to about 1.25 cups each). Each dose was added to a large glass of grapefruit juice (after adjusting our doses according to body weight), mixed our cocktails and drank up.<BR>
<BR>
After one hour, we all began to feel drunk/stoned and had trouble walking. My stomach was upset from all the tart grapefruit juice and lemon juice, but I was too anxious to care. I decided to read other psychnauts' DXM accounts on the Internet, but as soon as I got onto the web, my eyes failed me. I couldn't read the words. I soon lost interest in the screen, lay in my dark room with 2 friends, and had my first out of body experience.<BR>
<BR>
It was tunnel vision in the literal sense. That within my field of view existed, and nothing peripheral did. I had no concept of right, left, up or down. Anything or anyone in my sight path became the whole focus of my being, a puzzle to be worked out. I lost control of my legs, arms and reflexes. The wave hit me so fast that I immediately assumed that I had overdosed. I had read how dangerous 4th plateau trips can be and decided that I needed more babysitters. I tried to go out in the living room. Gravity increased in strength and my legs felt weighed down.<BR>
<BR>
Most of my friends were as useless as I was, so I was not to be cheered up by them. I was no longer in control of my body, which then stumbled out onto the porch and lit a cigarette. The smoking made me ill, and I was sweating bullets, so I decided to take a cold shower. Instead, I sat on the edge of the tub and marveled at the toilet, wanting to throw up. The toilet waited patiently, like a sea creature, for me to lean over so it could gobble me up. My friend L then came in to rescue me. I ranted confusedly that the world was ending and that I would die 'tonight'. L wasn't as bad off as I, he understood that I was ragingly paranoid. So he sat with me trying to help me calm down. Suddenly, every emotion of which I am capable rushed through me. I was terrified, but excited. I laughed uncontrollably with tears in my eyes. Then I puked.<BR>
<BR>
The paranoia immediately lifted. I knew that I would no longer die tonight because the (very little) DXM left unabsorbed in my stomach was gone now. I didn't feel nauseous anymore, but I was very claustraphobic. L and another friend took me out for a walk. The cool summer night rejuvenated me. I began to enjoy my tunnel vision more. The outer stairway was a momentous challenge. I took a couple of minutes, but I mastered the daunting distance of one flight by crawling down backwards on all fours.<BR>
<BR>
We took long walk around the apartment grounds. At certain times, balance would become difficult (especially in grassy areas), and I would drop to all fours again to walk. This earned me the nickname 'DXM Monkey'. When I walked, it was like gliding. I took long exaggerated, steps which allowed me to see my feet (out in front of me) and remind me that I wasn't flying. I spoke about senseless things, mumbling to myself and my friends for the whole duration. People we passed along the way probably feared me, but I didn't care unless they were standing right in front of me.<BR>
<BR>
My vision shifted like slowly advancing frames of a film. I focused on an object, becoming one with it, until I had successfully circumvented it. Then I found another one to guide me. The decision not to drive was never a problem because it never even occured to us to go somewhere else. The apartment courtyard was a big enough puzzle to master. We went for several 'nature walks' that night, and often ended up camped out in the courtyard again to watch an ongoing night game of sand volleyball played by our neighbors. Seven psychonauts, all completely twisted, sat in the middle of the lawn, smoking cigarettes and staring at the volleyball court.<BR>
<BR>
The rest of the night seemed like a cocktail party. Everybody was loud and busy-playing music, making phone calls, chain smoking on the balcony and talking about our trip. It was the cleanest high I've ever felt. I was pleasantly insane for 6 hours (which took an eternity to pass). There was no waiting impatiently for the comedown, like on LSD. At first, the DXM got right on top of me, but I eventually took control of my (distant) body (or 'took the reins', as we now call it) and had a great time. DXM is by no means a rave or dance drug, but it worked very well for a tame night at home with friends. <BR>
<BR>
The walk through the Nature Tunnel is something I will probably repeat, but I will watch my dosage very closely in the future. We reached the 3rd plateau, and it almost overwhelmed me. I fear what I would find at the 4th.
