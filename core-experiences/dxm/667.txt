First of all I don't recomend this to anybody. Before I got on the internet and informed myself about DXM, I met this guy at a Phish concert that introduced me to DXM. He told me about DXM. He said 1 bottle of Delsym would make me trip my nuts off. But I kind of blew him off.<BR>
<BR>
A couple of months later I couldn't cop any thing good and I went to the drug store and bought 1 bottle of Delsym and drank it. The trip was awesome. I continued to use DXM, slowly building up to 4 bottles of Delsym. Which is over 2000 mg. And one time I think I drank 5 bottles. But I'm not sure.<BR>
<BR>
Well, as the DXM kicked in I was doing good for a while but I had to lie down. I blacked out for a while and when I came to. I was in a castle. There were ghostly beings walking in and out of the room. I no longer realized what I had done. The Ghostly beings were looking at me and I could here them trying to communicate with me, but the only thing I could understand was that they wanted my to close my eyes and rest. I trusted them. I guess I blacked out out again and when I opened my eyes The room had changed now I was a little scared. I was in a jeweled room. What I mean is every thing was covered with jewels. Every time I closed my eves and opened them I was in a different room.<BR>
<BR>
And one time I was outside in a open plain with very few trees.Through out this voyage the Ghostly Beings were with me. I felt like I was traveling through other dimensions. I black out again and came through the trip where I knew I was gonna be ok. So be safe and use comon sense.
