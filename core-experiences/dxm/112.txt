Well, me and my friends are all artist, wether it be musical, or visual (I personally am a Digital and Traditional artist) - we do alot of 'drugs' together for the experience and such... we often do acid and marijuana, but this time, one of us (well call him *C*) had gotten the idea to try something called 'DXM'.  *T* and I had never heard of 'DXM', so *T* and I agreed to go over to *C*'s house and try this new drug.  When we asked to see the substance, he exclaimed that he hadn't bought it yet, and that we had to go to the dealer's place.  (DOH)<BR>
<BR>
Me and *T* were getting mad at *C* for not having it, untill *C* told *T* and I to jump in his car, we soon arrived at our local K-Mart and we jumped out to go inside (me and *T* assumed we were buying snacks for the trip).  When we went down the antibiotics isle, *C* held up a bottle of Robatussin and pointed to the active ingredient (Ane one of the ONLY ones..) and *T* and I laughed furiously of course. :)  <BR>
<BR>
Well we got back to *C*'s house and we poured our 'DXM' (hehe) bottles into a cup and we downed the horrid-tasting-cherry-flavored-childhood-nightmare-medicine.  *C* ended up vomiting about an hour later, and he said he was coming up.  *T* and I went inside and sat down to watch the Aphex Twin (Window Licker) Video - extremely funny... anyway; *T* exclaimed that his scalp itched 'like a m*th*r f*ck*r' and asked me to scratch it for him, as well as his back.  So I scratched his back and scalp to ease his already-going-bad-trip.  After I had scratched him for a while, I was watching TV and I noticed that I was itching too, I passed it off and ignored it, after a while it was completly un-ignorable.  I quickly ran into *C*'s bathroom and took off my shirt, and ran his sink as cold as the water would get, and I rubbed it all over myself, this soothed it untill I was dry again... most of the night I had bright red hands that were puffy and itchy as if I was russling through a bush of poison ivy.  Sooo... My experience with DXM was:<BR>
<BR>
1)  Extreme itching all over body and scalp<BR>
2)  Dizzyness<BR>
3)  Hands enflamed, puffy, itchy, red<BR>
4)  Extreme increase in body temprature (we didn't measure our tempratures, but we were all sweating like pigs...)<BR>
<BR>
DXM, some like it, some dont... I suggest doing 1 bottle of Robatussin if you *MUST* try it.  Anything more then that will drive you insane if you get the same reaction me and *T* did...  NOTE - *C* loved it and didnt get any of the side effects we did, such as the itchiness and enflamed extremeties.
