I extracted the DXM using the wonderful agent lemon extraction guide found at Dextromethorphan FAQ (he didn't write it but I used the baggy funnel Idea). I did this because I didn't think I could down four 4-oz bottles of robo max without feeling sick the whole time, and puking many times.<BR>
<BR>
The first time I tried the extractions, I used 6 tablespoons of citric acid. Way too much. I puked my brains out. I only got half of it down. Figuring that it wasn't going to affect me at all I took several bong hits (to ease my stomach mostly.) About 3 hours after the bong hits I realized that I was WAY more stoned than I should have been. OK cool, so I absorbed some of the DXM/DXO, and the extraction did work.<BR>
<BR>
I tried again. This time I used 2 tablespoons of citric acid with four 4-oz bottles of Tussin max (generic robo max).  With a 90% yield of extraction (probably higher though) it would put me at about 16-18 mg/kg. Upper third plateau lower fourth. <BR>
 <BR>
I drank the solution with ease at 1:20 PM. Didn't even feel sick at all. Twenty minutes later I started to feel that buzz, light-headed, and my vision started slowing down, felt like I was seeing things in frames.<BR>
<BR>
Realizing that the DXM was getting a lot stronger a lot more quickly than my normal 4-oz dose, I began to prepare for the rest of the day. I put in my favorite tripping music, Roger Waters' Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking, and put it on repeat.<BR>
<BR>
I felt the normal 4-oz peak at 30 minutes into the trip. Ten minutes later I couldn't really focus on anything, partly because I was messed up, and partly because I couldn't tell the difference between one object and the next. It seems like nothing was real. Things started mixing around with other things, and I decided that if I couldn't see I should just close my eyes. When I did that I saw really weird walls and objects (mostly black red and purple colored). I started accelerating and moving really fast through those objects. I felt like I was an F-16 trying to do a canyon run. The objects were zooming by so fast it was unbelievable. It started to go with the music (I think). This went on for a good 20 minutes with my eyes closed and all. <BR>
<BR>
My friend who was trip sitting thought I had passed out, he touched me, and I opened my eyes and tried to look at him. I tried to say I'm ok, but I don't know what came out. Then I realized something was really wrong. There was something I really needed to do, I didn't know what it was at first. I tried to think. That didn't work so I stopped thinking. I instinctively stood up. I took a step, and then fell to my hands and knees. I started to crawl. My conscious mind had no Idea of where I was going, but I didn't seem to care. I got to the bathroom. I thought, OHH that's what's wrong, I have to pee. I stood up leaned over the toilet and peed for a very very long time (so it seemed, but I think it actually was a pretty big pee). I crawled back to the couch and layed down to go to the canyon, this time it wasn't really a canyon, more like a merry go round, spinning really fast. Then I felt like I was flipping in all sorts of directions. Spinning and flipping and zooming around in this little fake world I created in my head. <BR>
<BR>
My friend checked up on my after about 15 minutes, (so he told me) I remember opening my eyes. I saw him, but everything was glazed over with a bright white light. I saw his face, and I saw a white light, that's all. I said I was ok, (at least I tried).  I then closed my eyes again. The spinning and flipping was the last thing I saw. At this point I have about a 2-hour memory lapse. I can't remember a thing that went on inside my head, I really wish I did though.  My friend said he checked up on me every 20 minutes or so and I said something that sounded like 'I fi'.<BR>
He translated it to I'm fine. <BR>
<BR>
The next thing that I remember was I was looking down at my body from above my head.  I was thinking, 'What is this, what are all these things around this thing'. A thought popped into my head, it said, this body is you. I was very confused. It was as if I had never seen my body before and I didn't even know I had a body. I knew that I existed, but what is that silly chunk of meat there sitting on that couch. That couldn't be me, how could I possibly be that, that thought of me being that chunk of meant was stupid to me. SO, I tried to think of who I really was, my name popped into my head, it sounded really weird, but I knew it was my name. So finally I convinced myself that the body is in fact a body, and it is in fact MY body. I think that was me coming down from the 4th plateau (the 4th plateau of which I have no memory of). I then went back to my body, and looked around the room, it was 4 PM. <BR>
<BR>
MY vision was going at about a frame a second, and everything still had a white glaze to it. I sat back and listened to the music that was still repeating, I stared at a white wall (it's usually brown) in which I saw geometric patterns (changing at about a frame a second). This lasted for a good 2-3 hours when I finally got back to the 2nd plateau stoned feeling (ahh, comfortable territory). But still my vision was only recycling at about 2 frames a second. This 2nd plateau stoned feeling went on for the rest of the night until I went to bed at 12.  <BR>
<BR>
I woke up 10 hours later with a little headache, but nothing 2 Advil won't cure. <BR>
<BR>
It was a really really really cool experience and next time I try it I'm going to make it a point to remember what happens at the 4th plateau.
