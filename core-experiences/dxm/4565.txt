AT ABOUT 7PM i drank a bottle of tussin max strength. i had spent alot of time investigating its effects on the web and figured id try it myself.i am very experienced with lsd/shrooms/x ect,however this was a first with dxm<BR>
about 45 min after i drank it i got very sick, throwing up the contents of my stomach,then continuing with dry heaves...VERY PAINFUL..after this i sat down in front of the open window, due to my extreme sweating. i did at this time feel very strange,similar to me to the trip you recieve off morning glory seeds. i can pretty much say that  even though i was 'tripping'i was not feeling 'good'.<BR>
<BR>
about every 45 min for the first three hours i would get the dry heaves, along with alternating between hot and cold flashes.  I did not get to sleep until 6 am, due to stomach cramps and muscle tremors I was having.  When I did fall asleep I woke up feeling ver much hungover, groggy, uncoordinated, sick to my stomach, etc.  Just now (22 hours later) I am starting to feel better.<BR>

I have read all the stories of people praising DXM, I may have just been the exception to the rule, but I know I will never take it again,it was  pure hell..Stick to the illegal trips.
