About a year ago, summer of 1998, i got my own apartment and moved out of my boyfriends house. I went crazy...first this guy at work offered me a quarter or about 8 lines so i took it but that was just to get me to come back. And, boy, did i come back. Alot. I pawned my VCR, my stereo, my cd's anything for that high. I was doing it every night and day on the hour...even at work. One Saturday night, me and a friend got 2 eight balls or about 30 lines or more. We decided to go clubing and do what we had in the bathrooms there. We danced and had a great time...i loved the shit out of that high. <BR>

Then, we ran out. So i went to my dealer and we went to a hotel at about 2:30 a.m. to party some more. He pulled out an ounce of cocaine and if u know about cocaine, u know that's alot of shit! So, we kept drinking and kept doing lines till i couldnt see straight anymore litterally. The room started shaking back and forth and i couldnt speak, i couldnt even go to the restroom...I knew my body was shutting down but i kept doing lines one after the other. Then, my best friend passed out and started convulsing on the bed. I lost it... we put her in the bathtub but it didnt help much. She was dying. Then, i blacked out and started convulsing into seizures just like her. When i woke up the next morning, i felt like shit, the worst feeling ever. I decided then to go clean. So, i moved back in with my boyfriend and i've been clean ever since, but i have long term anxiety attacks because of this and nightmares...it's been a year and i'm still paying for my mistake.
