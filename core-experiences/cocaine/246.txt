I was introduced to coke 6 months ago. Since then I have battled in my mind as to whether or not I should keep doing it. I have occasionally done ecstasy and speed for the past 5 years and do really enjoy the highs that these drugs give me, so I was more than interested in trying cocaine when my boyfriend suggested that we get some. After tentatively snorting my first lines, I began to feel confident and very talkative. My first night on coke was a good one. I now like to do coke every weekend. Being an intelligent 22 year old female, I know the risks of doing these drugs and I choose to take them.<BR>

My main reason against doing cocaine is not the health problems or worry of addiction, but is that I am always waiting for the weekend to get high. When Monday comes I can't wait till friday, and the days become a chore. I want to be able to enjoy every day of my life and achieve my ambitions, but at this rate I will stay in a minimum wage job for the rest of my life waiting for my highs. I know I could make the decision to stop right now if I wanted to, take control of my life and start enjoying it, but I don't want to. I love getting high. One day I am going to have to make a choice and I know what the answer will be, but until then, I guess all my life will be is a mixture of good times on the weekends and some serious under-achieving.
