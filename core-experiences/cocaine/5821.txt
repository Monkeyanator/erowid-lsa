I had just broken up with my boyfriend who had been addicted badly to cocaine before we ever met, but I had never tried it.  I was totally depressed, and hated the fact that we had broken up, so I decided to make myself feel better. One of my girlfriends said that it would be a good idea to do some coke that night, no doubt it would make me feel better, she said. <BR>

Well, I did.  Over the next two months it was all I could look forward to every weekend.  Doing those beautiful, white, crystalline lines that I loved so much to break up, and then lick the card which I had done it with. Numbies, man I loved the numbies.<BR>

The next morning, after doing coke, my jaw would hurt from grinding my teeth, my mouth would be dry from talking so much, and I felt really bad about myself and who I was becoming, becuase I didn't give a fuck about anyone else but myself, which wasn't much like me.  Eventually, my boyfriend came back around to me, and I stopped using. (I should say I let him come back around.) But everytime I see it, smell it, or hear someone talk about it, my mouth waters, and I wish I had some in front of me, to make me feel so 'high.'
